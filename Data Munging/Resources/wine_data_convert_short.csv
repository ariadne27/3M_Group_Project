Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
14316,Argentina,"Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.",Famiglia Bianchi,86,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
14321,Argentina,"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.",Portillo Estate Bottled,86,10,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Merlot,Salentein
14331,Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and subtle oak aromas lead to a snappy, crisp, high-acid palate with pie cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There isn't much finish or extras here; basic and well cut.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Four Aces
14336,Argentina,"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",Año Cero,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Altocedro
14383,Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Viña Domingo F. Sarmiento Single Vineyard,86,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
14393,Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Finca Sophenia
14406,Argentina,"A black-fruit aroma comes with accents of tobacco and prune but also a strong, almost vegetal green angle.

This is a blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",,88,100,Other,Salta,,Red Blend,Bodega Tacuil
14422,Argentina,"This is dusty and smooth up front, with plenty of oak, balsamic, plum and berry aromas.

14467,Argentina,"For everyday Argentine Malbec, Trivento has the formula down. Round, smoky and full of berry fruit, with freshness, ample oak, and a smattering of herbs to go with more familiar plum and cherry components. A little generic, but good for the price. 41,000 cases made.",Select,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
14528,Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some oak and floral notes. The palate is fleshy and a bit hollow in feel, with peach and sweet, almost sugary melon and pineapple flavors. Finishes like a melon ball, but at least the mouthfeel is good and not flabby.",,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
14544,Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are a bit warm and herbal, while the palate has good feel and soft, earthy flavors of herbs and generic berry fruit. Light on the finish, with a slight leafy note. Has good mouthfeel and doesn't overdo it.",,85,12,Other,Famatina Valley,,Malbec,Las Vides
14545,Argentina,"Dark, smoky aromas suggest prune, licorice, coconut and shoe polish. The palate is sharper than the color would indicate, while flavors of dark berry, licorice and plum vie with oak then bitterness. Pinched and tangy at points, but balanced by oaky softness. 65% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Grand Reserve Trinita,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Piattelli
14547,Argentina,"Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.",Oak Cask,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Trapiche

14611,Argentina,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon.

Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
14617,Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha.

Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Broquel,86,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
14618,Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose.

14625,Argentina,"Borderline heavy, with stewy black fruit aromas that turn savory then murky and gaseous. The palate has clacky acidity and flavors of sweet, roasted berry fruits.

14672,Argentina,"Fruity and forward, but airing allows restraint and character to emerge.

Best in late 2008 into 2009.",IQUE,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
14703,Argentina,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",Reserve,88,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zolo
14732,Argentina,"Full and fruity, with a dusty edge to the nose and accents of black pepper. Fairly thick and textured on the palate, with a freshness of fruit that works well on the palate.

14737,Argentina,"A little funky and animal-like upon opening, but meatier and better later on.

14754,Argentina,"If you like Italian Moscato d'Asti, then think of this as a distant cousin. It's made from the Torrontés grape and it features sweet, tropical aromas of lychee and air freshener.

A classic no-brainer bubbly for receptions and parties involving cake and other sweets.",Deseado,86,15,Other,Argentina,,Torrontés,Familia Schroeder
14807,Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas.

14850,Argentina,"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element.

Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.",Punto Final Reserva,91,18,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
14857,Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab.

14889,Argentina,"Familiar aromas of lemon blossom and air freshener get it going, and all together it smells a lot like a bathroom cleanser.

14988,Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Catena Alta,93,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
15039,Argentina,"Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease.

15047,Argentina,"Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit. The palate might register as soft to some, but there's still a tannic foundation that bolsters blackberry, spice cake and molasses flavors. Not super long on the finish but intense in a lumbering sort of way. Drink now–2011.",Cadus,90,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nieto Senetiner
15052,Argentina,"This is a delicious and somewhat rare style of Malbec: it has none of the usual oak. What you wind up with is fruity, clean and pure. The body is maybe a touch leaner without the oak; the flavor profile is brighter and more linear.",Opalo,90,18,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Malbec,Mauricio Lorca
15053,Argentina,"Regal and ready, and showing equal amounts of early maturity along with youthful fruit and menthol aromas. The palate is saturated with raspberry and black cherry, while the lengthy finish offers coffee and chocolate.

15186,Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character.

15206,Argentina,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",,85,10,Other,Famatina Valley,,Malbec,Condor's Summit
15207,Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Reserva,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
15239,Argentina,"Balsam wood, pencil eraser, coconut, anise and blackberry aromas share the bouquet.

15265,Argentina,"Deep, lush, balanced and oaky, with bacon, floral notes and huge raspberry and cassis aromas.

Now–2015.",Catena Alta,92,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
15333,Argentina,"Rich, warm and possessing a ton of dry oak, this is one serious Argentine Cabernet. The palate is grippy as a rubber glove, with snappy berry flavors and pointed acidity.

It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Reserva,90,18,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
15340,Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",,90,17,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia

Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Saurus Patagonia Select,85,19,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Familia Schroeder
15472,Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas.

Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Henry Lagarde Reserve,85,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
15476,Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character.

15479,Argentina,"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Merlot,Ombu
15555,Argentina,"Rustic yet complete, with dark, sweet aromas of toasted coconut, mint and berry syrup. The palate is juicy and balanced, and that's really the key in distinguishing the top Bonardas from the more frequently found hard and scouring ones. In our book, Broquel is a Bonarda you can count on.",Broquel,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Trapiche
15572,Argentina,"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity.

Drink now through 2014.",Gran Reserva,92,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tomero
15582,Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",,92,70,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cheval des Andes
15601,Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more.

15616,Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab.

It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",,90,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chakana
15617,Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec.

15720,Argentina,"Deep purple in color and rich on the nose, with bacon, roasted berry, rubber, spice and heft.

15730,Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",Amado Sur,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,White Blend,Trivento
15742,Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity. Finishes toasty and a little herbal, with any leftover fruit heading quickly to the shadows.",Los Cardos,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Doña Paula
15839,Argentina,"A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke.

Interesting but very oaked up and not quite in perfect balance.",Henry Lagarde Vino de Guarda,88,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
15842,Argentina,"Despite tough vintage conditions, Bodega Septima got this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat right. The nose is dark, solid and full of attractive black fruit and coconut aromas.

15863,Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas.

Drink sooner than later.",Opalo,89,18,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mauricio Lorca
15898,Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on.

The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Poetico,89,21,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Malbec,Mauricio Lorca
15905,Argentina,"This straightforward apple and toast-dominated Chardonnay has medium weight and decent length. It's decidedly mainstream, a bit too one-dimensionally so. But it's still tasty in that mode, and oak-lovers will savor the spicy wood that comes up very strongly on the close. Again, good, but here a more reserved use of oak might yield a wine of more nuance and better balance.",Reserva,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
15910,Argentina,"This tangy and light-to-medium weight wine offers bright red fruit with slightly darker berry, chocolate and earth shadings.

15921,Argentina,"Flavorful, but very brisk, with moderate-to-high acidity. It's a modest wine, with blackberry and coffee aromas and flavors, slight tobacco accents and a short finish.

15947,Argentina,"Aggressive and a tad bit rough, but it's still young.

16054,Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit.

16232,Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins.

Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Luigi Bosca Reserva,88,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
16259,Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed.

16313,Argentina,"Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity.

A good wine, not without its fault.",Reserva,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
16336,Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
16347,Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.",Morena,90,30,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Blend,Viña Alicia
16395,Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Reserve Organic,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Caligiore
16398,Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",,88,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aleph
16460,Argentina,"This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering.",,87,50,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Antucura
16489,Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins. As Bonarda goes, this is a clear winner; it's blowsy and ribald on the nose, with tons of black fruit, coconut and mocha. The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Limited Edition Reserva,90,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Nieto Senetiner
16493,Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Carrascal,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
16541,Argentina,"Good wine, especially if you like some new oak that brings a lot of cream, vanilla and chocolate to the game. Along the way there's plenty of boysenberry, blueberry and other sweet dark-fruit flavors. A winner that should meet the expectations of many.",Reserve,88,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Novus
16543,Argentina,"Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes. The oak may be a bit buttery and the tannins fairly full, but overall this does a good job of impersonating a much pricier wine; it's big, liberally oaked, ripe and quite good as a whole.",Reserva,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
16546,Argentina,"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.",Q,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
16555,Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.",Prodigo Reserva,87,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alessandro Speri
16558,Argentina,"Still not sure what the difference is between Sur de los Andes and Alma de los Andes (they're from the same winery), but this wine seems a tiny bit more open and friendly than the Alma. It's evolved, sweet and full of blackberry and blueberry flavors. And the finish carries some warm baked notes that anchor the deal.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
16614,Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Gascón,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón
16615,Argentina,"This wine seems mulchy and warm; it comes out of the bottle with attitude and some fire. As it settles, you get berry, bramble and leather, and always does it seem a little “traditional” in style rather than modern and polished up. Definitely a full-bodied, oily wine that could use more flavor and fruit.",Reserva Finca Castro Barros,86,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
16652,Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Serie Magno Gran Reserva,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Fantelli
16661,Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet. The palate is healthy and snappy, with lively acidity pushing black cherry and meaty plum flavors. Whole and toasty on the finish, with touches of excellence throughout. Impressive for a first effort, with room to improve. Drink now through 2012.",ViBo,90,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viu Manent
16672,Argentina,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete.",Obra Prima Reserva,90,20,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Familia Cassone
16681,Argentina,"Santa Julia doesn't try to trick you with its wines. They are what they are, and for under  10 this creamy, berry-packed wine should please the masses. The fruit is plump and ripe, while the mouthfeel is round and healthy. A great model for quality, affordable Malbec.",,87,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
16769,Argentina,"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors. It initially seems flashy and ready for anything. But the more you run it across your palate, the more the acidity rises up. And before long it almost seems scouring and jumpy. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Grand Reserve,86,20,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Graffigna
16815,Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Reserva,89,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
16836,Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",,87,9,Other,San Juan,,Sauvignon Blanc,Las Moras
16845,Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Chakana
16851,Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
16854,Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard. This version offers peach and other stone-fruit aromas, while the palate presents smooth white fruit and toast flavors. Fairly long, with a healthy feel throughout.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
16904,Argentina,"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Deseado,85,13,Other,Neuquén,,Torrontés,Familia Schroeder
16907,Argentina,"Not nearly as intense and Cab-like as the 2003. For whatever reason, this vintage is bouncy and light, with a touch of smoked meat and rubber but mostly simple raspberry and cherry flavors. The feel borders on jammy, and it finishes with a touch of chocolate but also kind of herbal.",Reserva,85,18,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
16909,Argentina,"Despite some warm earth and compost on the nose, this shows positives such as solid cherry, plum and blackberry flavors. It opens on the midpalate but then thins out rather drastically on the finish. Like most in its class, it's hard Bonarda; but it has its merits, too.",,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Vila
16955,Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Atemporal,89,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alta Vista
16965,Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Serie A,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
16970,Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",,89,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Siesta
16987,Argentina,"As always, this late-harvest white delivers peach and lychee aromas, and it's even better in the mouth, where intense lychee and pineapple flavors rise up and steal the show.",Tardío,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Santa Julia
16996,Argentina,"Like most of Alma's wines, this Bonarda is smooth, fruity and approachable. The nose is simple and offers some spice, licorice and herb notes, while the berry flavors are just as they should be: easy and jammy. There's nothing challenging about this red; just pour it with pizza or burgers and enjoy.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alma de los Andes
16998,Argentina,"Punchbowl melon and tropical fruit aromas are the lead act. Next up is a zesty palate of green apple, melon and citrus. The body is a bit plump and round, while the finish shows orange peel and lime zest. Good for Mendoza Sauv Blanc.",Antá,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Telteca
17001,Argentina,"Warm earth and other dark, leathery aromas dominate. In the mouth, there's black cherry and raspberry flavors supported by scratchy tannins. Despite some grab and clumsiness, this is a good Cabernet with ripeness and a forward personality.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
17047,Argentina,"Black as night, with aromas of leather, wild berries and wet dog. It is salty and oaky in the mouth, with vanilla and tannin but not a whole lot of ripe, lovable dark fruit. Gets better as it evolves, but where's the dark, sweet fruit to match the oak, tannins and tightness?",Limited Edition,85,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Nieto Senetiner
17050,Argentina,"Quite piercing and fiery at first, which announces that it is fully oaked. Along the way there's savory notes, saucy leather and flashes of dark fruit. This would be a better wine with more fruit and flesh, and less barrel. The dill, vanilla and spice flavors are a bit too dominant.",Humberto Barberis Gran Reserva,85,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
17121,Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.",,89,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alma Negra
17122,Argentina,"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Gran Misterio,89,80,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra
17147,Argentina,"Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",Opalo,86,18,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Syrah,Mauricio Lorca
17154,Argentina,"We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy. The mouthfeel runs tight and the tannins are spunky and on the border of being rough. Maybe another year will settle it down.",Particular,86,30,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
17198,Argentina,"Chunky, big and forward, with some fiery horseradish and spent campfire on the nose. Blackberry, wild raspberry and leather work the demanding, starchy palate, and the finish is short and generally clean and healthy.",Reserva,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tamarí
17250,Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly. Aromas of sly dried berry take over, leading to a full, flush palate of plum, raspberry and raisin. Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Corte B,89,23,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
17258,Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha. The feel is full and well balanced, while the palate has a bright and lively personality with cherry, raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Smooth, tastes good and offers plenty of value.",,89,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
17264,Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",Catena,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
17265,Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",Punto Final Reserva,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
17267,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Eolo,89,79,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Trivento
17278,Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Obra Prima Coleccion,88,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Cassone
17285,Argentina,"Simple red-fruit aromas, sweetness and balance come right away on the bouquet, and the palate is basically the same thing: pleasant strawberry and raspberry flavors and a good feel. Nothing fancy but smooth and fun to drink. Commendable given that production is 50,000 cases.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
17297,Argentina,"Leather, mint and a touch of raisin make for a fairly ripe and mature bouquet. The palate follows with reasonably vibrant berry flavors and a little chocolaty heft. If it falls a bit flat on the tail that only means that it's not for aging and is meant to drink now.",,86,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
17307,Argentina,"Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit. Not as forward and clean as it should be; but has its benefits. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Ique,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
17309,Argentina,"Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.",Prodigo,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alessandro Speri
17368,Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Grand Reserve,84,20,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Graffigna
17416,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Brote Negro,88,100,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
17422,Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Reserve,88,19,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
17439,Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",Laborum Limited Edition,85,49,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Bodegas El Por Venir de los Andes
17445,Argentina,"Young and sturdy, with pear and apple aromas enveloped in popcorn and wood. The palate offers standard New World weight and sweetness along with flavors of pear, vanilla and oak. More on the full-bodied, oaky side, but generally it's balanced and approachable.",Reserva,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Nieto Senetiner
17446,Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Terruño Lunlunta,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
17453,Argentina,"Simple but nice in its class. The nose offers bulky but clean fruit and a touch of saddle, while the palate is ample, fruity and round. It flairs out on the finish but keeps rolling in the right direction. Good for the price.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
17456,Argentina,"Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.",Reserva,85,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terrazas de Los Andes
17497,Argentina,"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice.",,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
17501,Argentina,"We haven't seen much improvement in this wine since the 2003 vintage. It's still lacking forward, ripe fruit and instead shows more leather and drying, firm tannins. Shows glimpses of higher quality but can't support them.",,83,11,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Mayu
17502,Argentina,"Popcorn, green-apple and scallion aromas precede crisp, tart flavors of barely ripe peach and grapefruit. The finish is short and citrusy, boosted by choppy acids. Racy but not rich.",Saurus Extra Brut,83,10,Other,Neuquén,,Champagne Blend,Familia Schroeder
17510,Argentina,"Malbec seems like the best bet for this organic label, which has shown some shaky wines alongside this. Even this one has a mild lactic, pasty streak to the nose along with raspberry and peppery spice. Lacks the cuddle and depth of the better Argentine Malbecs.",,83,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Medanos
17517,Argentina,"Short on berries and jam and heavily oaked, thus fruit plays second fiddle to oak spice, spearmint and hard cinnamon on the nose. The palate is on the brambly side, while the finish is fairly long and a bit leathery. Has body and size but lacks the fine points.",Ikella,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
17590,Argentina,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",Reserva,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nieto Senetiner
17609,Argentina,"Honeysuckle and other sweet aromas greet you. In back of that there are flavors of pineapple, mango and apple. This runs crisp and tangy with more lemon-drop character than butter or vanilla.",Finca la Daniela,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Familia Barberis
17662,Argentina,"Sweet and reduced aromas of red licorice and prune lead to sketchy red cherry flavors and not much body. The wine is closed, hard and chewy, but with a lot of fruit-forward potency.",Organic,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,VinEcol
17664,Argentina,"Herbal aromas infiltrate the nose, and the palate features midlevel red fruit with a strong herbal edge. The finish shows saline, chocolate and pepper, and never does it rise much above struggling.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alfredo Roca
17667,Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.",Toso Brut,82,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Pascual Toso
17668,Argentina,"Big and spicy at first, and then vegetal, lesser characteristics seep in and take over. The palate has baked black fruit and a finish of bitter chocolate and pepper, but also some rooty, bark-like issues. There's no point of focus to this wine.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Alfredo Roca
17710,Argentina,"A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas.

17714,Argentina,"Opens with candied, chocolaty aromas that contradict its age. In the mouth, it's mature although the structure is breaking up; nonetheless, it's interesting and attractive, with herb, raspberry, tea, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Overall it's a different breed, and despite having lost its structure it's sly and well worth a go. Drink now.",Filósofos,88,60,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Red Blend,Viña El Cerno
17715,Argentina,"A nice, clean, fairly complex white is what this is. The nose is all lychee and jasmine, and it's not at all heavy or oily.

17724,Argentina,"Graham cracker is the lead aroma, and that's followed by jammy fruit, cookie dough and finally a touch of raisin. The palate is plump for an '08, with berry flavors, herbal notes and some bitterness. A touch clipped and rough, but a good effort for a tough year.",,88,32,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Luca
17735,Argentina,"Soft, lightly fragrant and peachy, with a hint of talcum powder to the nose. The palate offers your basic mix of melon and lychee, while the feel is good and there's a persistent finish. Straightforward stuff.",Uma,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Telteca

17749,Argentina,"Sweet pear and powdered sugar carry the confected nose, while the palate is also on the sweet side, with sugared citrus and banana flavors.

17824,Argentina,"For an affordable Argentine Chardonnay, this is not a bad effort. But it is a little oily and loaded down with movie popcorn and buttery aromas.

17830,Argentina,"A little charred and bulky, but pretty good for a basic New World Cabernet. The nose is a mix of ripe fruit, licorice and herbs, while the palate is tame and veers to strawberry. Simple and a touch herbal.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
17834,Argentina,"Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity.

17844,Argentina,"Some dry oak and smoke frames simple earth and berry aromas, but the mouth is condensed and flat. There isn't much bounce to this overripe red; it's heavy and seems to have caught a lot of sun in the vineyard.",,83,9,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
17845,Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",Reserve,83,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
17846,Argentina,"Intense on the nose and colorful, but in the end this wine shows little character, complexity or style. It's all about color and extract but you don't get much richness, charm or ripeness. And it's almost sassy and tangy on the palate and finish.",Finca Los Lirios de los Andes,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Faustina
17847,Argentina,"Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map. This overoaked, charred Cabernet is a perfect example of a wine without a cause. It's burnt, herbal and while it has mouthfeel, nothing seems to be working in tandem.",Famiglia Bianchi,83,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
17883,Argentina,"Round, lifted and bright, with full berry, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round and the body full, while the flavor profile includes roasted blackberry, coffee, chocolate and coconut. A full and chewy wine that comes across nice given the troubles of the '08 vintage.",Serie Magno,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
17887,Argentina,"A pretty white wine with lively aromas, flavors and feel. The bouquet issues attractive lychee, melon and vanilla cream aromas, while the palate flows forth with apple, melon and exotic citrus flavors. Just spicy enough on the tail end, with a lasting taste of lychee fruit. Delicate, solid and fresh.",,88,13,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Filus
17888,Argentina,"Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum. Woody and toasty, too, but dry and spicy rather than sweet, blowsy and creamy. A nice Malbec for all occasions.",Altosur,88,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
17905,Argentina,"Minty, oaky and spicy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that are potent.

It finishes well, with freshness along with a dark, smoky tail.",,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Pascual Toso
17911,Argentina,"Light and spicy, with snappy, lean flavors of cherry and cranberry. This is more tart and underwhelming than most Malbec fans probably want, but it's not bad if you crave a lip-smacking red with zest.",Cava Negra,83,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
17913,Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a touch of hard cheese backing that up. The mouth is jumpy and rustic, with raspberry and cherry skin flavors. Finishes lean, scouring and a bit hard.",,83,9,Other,San Juan,,Bonarda,Las Moras
17916,Argentina,"Sort of soupy and stewy to begin with. The palate is stocky and forward, with short black plum and berry flavors. Quite ripe on the back end as it finishes chewy and soft. Organic.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alto Salvador
17920,Argentina,"All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price. It is a touch musky and heavy on the nose, but the palate holds form as it delivers round banana and melon flavors along with some vanilla and sponge cake on the finish.",,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
17921,Argentina,"A bit heavy and bitter, but otherwise this is pretty decent. Not much can be said about the mild nose: it's typical but not that expressive. The palate, meanwhile, has a lot of weight and peach-pit bitterness, while the finish is a bit sluggish.",,83,9,Other,Famatina Valley,,Torrontés,La Puerta
17925,Argentina,"Warm and oaky up front, with menthol. The palate is short and feels kind of flat as it offers up standard raspberry and other red-fruit flavors. Finishes with milk chocolate notes but overall it doesn't have much texture or personality.",Estate,83,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Doña Paula
17926,Argentina,". Pencil eraser, tomato leaf and sweet fruit aromas are the appropriate set up to a candied palate that's sweet with cherry and strawberry essence. It's a wine with kick but it has also has chunky side.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fantelli
17928,Argentina,"Rather raisiny and herbal, with deep plum and blackberry flavors. It's a weighty wine with a finish that runs straight to prune and chocolate. A bit heavy and dull even at this everyday price point.",Solo Tango,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tawert S.A.
17930,Argentina,"Quite syrupy and stewy, with chunky fruit flavors and a lot of wayward heft. On the plus side there's coffee and bitter chocolate, but overall there's just not much elegance or lightness.",,83,9,Other,Famatina Valley,,Malbec,La Puerta
17937,Argentina,". The citrus and grapefruit aromas come across a little mealy and the wine never really rises above its candied citrus and apple cider qualities. It is pretty good on the tongue, however, and feels juicy. If chilled down it won't be a bad quaff.",,83,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Zolo
17974,Argentina,"This wine requires breathing time to show its true colors. Early on it's reduced and cheesy, but soon it offers cleaner aromas of cola, berry and dark plum. The acidity is a bit high and sheering, but on the plus side it's fresh and driving, with bright cherry and berry flavors along with ample oak.",Grand Reserve,87,20,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Graffigna
17981,Argentina,"Floral and fruity to open the show, and then there's plenty of oak and resin aromas coming next.

Juicy, fresh and healthy, but quite oaky.",Reservado,87,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
17995,Argentina,"Starts out earthy and gaseous but the bouquet settles on round, full blackberry aromas. Lush, grabby and full in the mouth, with bold blackberry flavors that are clean, forward, uncomplicated and even a bit elegant. Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.",La Puerta Alta,87,15,Other,Famatina Valley,,Bonarda,Valle de la Puerta
18002,Argentina,Spearmint and dry red fruit carry the nose. The palate shows basic sweet cherry and strawberry flavors but not much Cabernet character. All in all it's a stripped-back wine that offers rudimentary red-fruit character.,,82,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alto Salvador
18004,Argentina,"Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish. The palate is a saturated fusing of berry syrup, chocolate and alcohol. Almost Port-like in weight and style, but also very aggressive.",Libertad Vineyard,82,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Benegas
18012,Argentina,"A stewy Cabernet; the nose mixes cola with Fernet Branca and never does the wine approach anything we might label charming. It's linear and tight, with narrow flavors of cranberry and cherry. Short on texture and never shows much variation.",Santa Isabel,82,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nieto Senetiner
18014,Argentina,"Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.",Famiglia Bianchi,82,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Chardonnay,Valentin Bianchi
18016,Argentina,"The bouquet hits with reduced aromas of children's vitamin and pineapple, while the palate goes straight to hard cider and orange peel. It's a firm, acidic style that finishes citric and a touch bitter. Doesn't really smell or taste much like Chardonnay.",Clara Benegas,82,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Benegas
18023,Argentina,"Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.",Reserva,81,15,Other,Famatina Valley,,Bonarda,La Puerta
18025,Argentina,Nail polish on the nose along with clay will have you wondering. The palate on this organic wine is also a bit shaky; rubbery cherry and raspberry flavors are lean and the aftertaste is fiery. Too unusual and challenging.,Reserve Organic,81,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Caligiore
18029,Argentina,"Ripe to overripe apple grips the nose, while the palate deals one-note citrus flavors. It's a flush, fat Chardonnay that's losing balance with each passing day. Finishes with an avalanche of orange character.",Solo Tango,81,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Tawert S.A.
18060,Argentina,"Light, airy, tropical and very nice for an under-$10 Argentine Chardonnay. The nose is nice and easy, while the flavors of orange, melon and lychee are tropical but seem right for the wine's body and acidity. Easygoing as they come, with a hint of sweetness on the finish.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Tilia
18064,Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level. Good Malbec but not a value at $45.",Afincado Las Compuertas Single Vineyard,87,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes
18070,Argentina,"By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings. But the palate is limited in richness and the flavors are standard, with char and barrel notes creating bitterness. Nice and honest for a subpar year.",,87,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Mendel
18137,Argentina,"Having tasted the previous vintages and not liking them all that much, I can safely say that this 2010 is a much better, cleaner, more varietally correct version of Torrontés. It's clean, fresh and defined by light aromas and flavors of lime and green melon. Juicy and soda-like on the finish.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Pascual Toso
18141,Argentina,"Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full. The flavors follow the nose, meaning there's a savory, roasted quality to the wine but also jammy raspberry fruit notes. Chewy and a bit marinated, but it's quite good for the price.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tilia
18142,Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.",,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tomero
18143,Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",La Puerta Gran Reserva,87,40,Other,Famatina Valley,,Red Blend,Valle de la Puerta
18241,Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this. Oaky and rubbery on the nose, with scattered, lean berry fruit flavors and bitterness. Like many '08s, it's short on richness and comes across unfocused. That said, it's still a good wine that's not badly made.",Signature,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Susana Balbo
18247,Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas. That leads to a tannic, semisharp palate with spunky blackberry fruit that comes with spice and chocolate shadings. Flavorful and correct, but a little tight and tough.",Old Vine,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terra Rosa
18248,Argentina,"Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terrazas de Los Andes
18249,Argentina,"Earthy and warm on first take, with deep fruit and soupy side aromas. The palate is juicy and lively, with blackberry flavors as well as toasty accents.

18269,Argentina,"A touch creamy and showing fresh corn and haystack on the nose, but in the mouth it's plump, good and mild, with fleshy white fruit flavors sitting in front of a smooth, lightly pithy finish. Yes, it's another warm-climate tropical Chardonnay. But it's a good one that's easy to drink.",Catena,87,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
18282,Argentina,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber.

Very good for value-priced Argentine CS.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
18346,Argentina,"Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas. This is one concentrated, tannic bruiser; it's fully extracted and roasted, with blackberry, molasses, pepper and coffee flavors. A lush, round, jammy specimen that pours on richness in place of elegance and sophistication.",,87,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Siesta
18350,Argentina,"Warm and generous on the nose, with hints of brick dust and herbal strawberry fruit.

Works well, although it worked better when it was an under-$10 wine.",Urban Uco,87,14,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
18359,Argentina,"Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.",Zeta,87,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Zuccardi
18438,Argentina,"Opens with a slight chemical-smelling topping to berry, raisin and cheesy aromas. The palate is chunky on one hand and driving on the other, with berry and raisiny flavors.

18482,Argentina,"Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors.

18483,Argentina,"Pungent aromas of citrus range from lemon to orange, and there's also an oily element to the bouquet.

18489,Argentina,"Tropical and typical for the variety, with lychee and oily match stick on the nose. The palate is competent, with lemon-lime, apple and spiced Asian pear flavors.

18540,Argentina,"Waxy and warm, with peach, sweet ham, spice and vanilla aromas. As Catena Alta goes, this is not stellar. In fact, it's light on fruit and lacks the depth of flavor and punch you'd hope to see from a $34 wine. What you get is a fleshy, soft Chard with mild peach, papaya and melon flavors, and then a whack of finishing oak.",Catena Alta,86,34,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
18547,Argentina,"Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis.

18561,Argentina,"Rubbery, tarry and quite black in nature, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and meaty, spicy dark-berry flavors.

18991,Argentina,"Clean, timid and melony on the nose, with an emphasis on clean. Fresh and light in the mouth, and tasty despite being 100% uncomplicated. Flavors of sweet apple, pear and citrus are pleasant and should carry mass appeal. Good for an everyday white quaffer.",,85,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Funky Llama
19008,Argentina,"Neutral smelling other than a hint of peach and vanilla on the bouquet. Comes across a bit heavy and warm, but not too much so. Flavors of soft melon are appealing, and the finish is fleshy. Drink now before it loses its spunk.",Trumpeter,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Rutini
19012,Argentina,"Earthy and leathery smelling, but very much on the light-bodied side for Malbec. The palate is angular and slightly acidic, with juicy, spicy red-cherry flavors. Racy and lean on the finish, with a final wash of cleansing acids.",Tarquino,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Argento
19015,Argentina,"Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well. The palate is fairly thick and solid, with big tannins and flavors of candied fruits and carob that lean toward green. Shows big body and weight, but the nose is only fair while the flavors are herbal.",Altosur,84,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
19054,Argentina,"Tropical and blowsy on the nose. The palate is now chunky and heavy, while the flavors are mustardy and oily, with fruit notes that fall into the melon, peach and orange field. Flat and short on the finish, which indicates that it's already fading. Better to wait for the 2010.",Urban Uco,84,11,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,O. Fournier
19056,Argentina,"Light and herbal on the nose, with a dilute set of raspberry and strawberry aromas. The palate has some creaminess but overall it tastes generic and baked, with syrupy sweetness at its core. An average wine with jammy qualities and focus issues.",Reserva,84,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Uva Negra
19062,Argentina,"More leafy and mulchy than ideal, with coffee, herbal notes and a light green quality to the nose. The feel is starchy, and the flavors run burnt, mildly green and sweet, with a pasty, sticky finish. Has some merit but also falls a little short.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Árido
19065,Argentina,"Light and airy, with orange blossom and powdered sugar aromas. The palate is round and offers enough crisp acidity to keep the wine's lychee and lemon-lime flavors moving in the right direction. Reasonably good for ten bucks.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
19071,Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with a simple, candied, somewhat strained nose. The palate feels sharp while the acidity-tannin combo creates a narrowing mouthfeel. Flavors are roasted, herbal and lemony, while the finish is jumpy and edgy.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Uva Negra
19077,Argentina,"A little stinky and oily, which is often the downfall of the variety. The palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary, i.e. simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn. Seems only semifresh at a young age.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Torrontés,Bodega Goulart
19078,Argentina,"Smells foxy and broken up, with a slight stemminess. The palate is tannic and drawing, with generic black fruit flavors that are candied with brown sugar and molasses. Sweet, rough, tough and like 1,000 others. Will do best with food, which should absorb some of the tannic shock.",Reserve,84,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
19118,Argentina,"A bit gaseous on the nose, with cidery apple aromas. The palate is waxy, oily and heavy, with chunky melon and papaya flavors. Meaty and full-bodied for a value-priced Chard, but also heavy and struggling for balance.",Urban Uco,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,O. Fournier
19122,Argentina,"Rubbery and muddled at first, then more clarity arises with airing. The palate is firm, rather lean and acidic, with angular berry and cassis flavors. Finishes on the sharp side, with snappy, pointed acidity and crispness.",,84,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Serrera
19124,Argentina,"Mildly tropical on the nose, but for the most part the bouquet lacks punch. The palate has friction and an oily feel, while the flavors are generic as they suggest apple and lime. Chalky and kind of bland on the finish; seems to be fading.",Broquel,84,15,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Trapiche
19125,Argentina,"Earthy aromas mix with high-toned red fruit scents, while the palate is narrow and linear, with mildly green, saucy flavors that crowd out mild red fruit notes that fight to enter the picture. Herbal on the finish, but not offensive or difficult to drink.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
19127,Argentina,"A blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin that's more novel than impressive. The nose offers light citrus and spice, the body is creamy and soft, and the palate sweet with papaya, melon and pineapple. Creamy on the finish as well, and low in acidity.",Tiara,84,30,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,White Blend,Viña Alicia
19130,Argentina,"Other than showing orange and tangerine, the nose is a bit too much like air freshener. In the mouth, it's wet but on the hollow side, with dilute innocuous flavors. Decent but low on flavor; seemingly fading.",Premium,84,13,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Piattelli
19170,Argentina,"Big, rubbery and smoky, with exotic fruit aromas that seem roasted. The palate is tough, tannic and clipped, with herbal, thick flavors of berry, baking spices and coffee. Finishes big but flat and hard, with lasting herbal flavors.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alamos
19171,Argentina,"Funky and sharp at first, with aromas of a dog fresh out of the rain. The palate is choppy and a bit hot, with sharp, generic cherry flavors along with some carob. Finishes with angular, tart flavors and notes of coffee and mocha.",,84,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
19173,Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, with flat aromas of apple and peach. The palate has a melony feel and sweet flavors of mango and mandarin orange.

19182,Argentina,"Smells a bit waxy and grassy, with mild, distant white-fruit aromas. The palate feels pithy and chalky, with generic citrus flavors and then citrus pith on the back end. Finishes with more pithiness and white grapefruit.",,84,11,Other,San Juan,,Pinot Grigio,Alma Mora

19191,Argentina,"Hefty but kind of flat on the bouquet, with tomato and herb aromas. The palate has tannic bite and dark, candied flavors of sweet berry and burnt brown sugar. Finishes peppery, with a lingering candied, burnt sweetness.",Roble,84,13,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viamonte
19196,Argentina,"Fairly bland on the nose, with only a pinch of mild peach and candle wax. The palate is full but wholly generic in terms of flavors: look for sweet pineapple in front of a soft, almost cloying finish. Drink now.",,84,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
19231,Argentina,"Vanilla and toast aromas are prominent but the fruit is so subdued that overall the wine is out to lunch. Snappy and showing okay acidity in the mouth, but the flavors are dull and melony, with toasty vanilla notes that don't help it enough.",,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Los Nevados
19233,Argentina,"Light and tomatoey in color, with dry, cheesy, earthy aromas. The palate is dilute but has sticky tannins, and the flavors are tangy, citrusy and not overly sound. Finishes roasted and clumsy. An awkward wine.",,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,The Wait
19235,Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for mild hay and/or straw aromas. The palate is a bit weighty for being so short on flavor. Speaking of which, the wine is clean but tastes hollow, with only sparse flavors of peach and nectarine registering.",Trumpeter,83,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
19237,Argentina,"Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick.

19241,Argentina,"Raw on the nose, with a hard, tannic palate that features sweet black-fruit flavors, a chemical burn and raisin.

Finishes roasted, with licorice and rock-hard tannins.",Luna Benegas,83,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benegas
19243,Argentina,"Neutral smelling with a hint of lemon-lime and children's vitamin. The palate is wet but doesn't bring much more in the way of feel, while the flavors are flat, melony and hint at apple. This wine is old by PG standards but not yet dead. It's hanging in there.",,83,10,Other,Famatina Valley,,Pinot Grigio,Condor's Summit

19252,Argentina,"Earth and rubber aromas dominate the nose, which isn't what you'd call fresh or inviting. The palate improves only slightly, with piercing acidity pressing green-leaning plum and berry flavors. Oaky on the finish and marginal overall.",,83,11,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Alma Mora
19255,Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish. Hints at quality but doesn't bring it home; and it seems tired.",Premium Made With Organic Grapes Blend de Familia,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Familia Los Agüeros
19258,Argentina,"An odd bird on the nose, where floral, lavender aromas replace the normal set of cassis and berry. In the mouth, it's so tannic that it's like chewing nails; the flavors, therefore, seem choppy and hard, like roasted blackberry and sugar beets. Very woody and mentholated, too.",Reservado,83,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carlos Basso
19290,Argentina,"Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes.

19295,Argentina,"Loud, oily and almost caustic on the nose, with a chemical burn. The palate is better due to its tangy citric flavors, but it's still jumbled and oily, and the finish leaves a burnt-tasting residue.",,82,10,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Tilia
19298,Argentina,"Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors.

19303,Argentina,Sweet cotton candy and mocha aromas come across as confected and work to obscure a high-acid palate that offers a slight hint of chocolate and mint. More oak comes up on the finish.,,82,10,Other,Famatina Valley,,Syrah,Condor's Summit
19306,Argentina,"Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish. Bulky but not very good.",Barrel Select,82,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Bodega Norton

19312,Argentina,"Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney.

19315,Argentina,"Herbal, green, stemmy Merlot with sourness and compromised aromas, flavors and mouthfeel. Tastes bitter and on the harsh side, with a narrow, grabby finish. Too green and mean, especially for $20.",Reserva,81,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Bodega Norton
19316,Argentina,"Smells like corn and a burning hay field, and the palate has little to no fruit left. The mouthfeel is wet and grabby, while the finish is bready then turns bitter. On its last legs; wait for 2010.",Alto Las Tacas,81,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Vistandes
19317,Argentina,"Vegetal from start to finish, as the aromas begin with tomato and bell pepper. The palate is exactly the same, with baked, earthy, sweet and green flavors.

19319,Argentina,"Thin and sharp as broken glass, with an herbal, sour flavor profile and a tart, sheering mouthfeel and finish.

19352,Argentina,"Rubbery and gassy smelling, with overtones of green, herbaceous fruit. The palate is sharp and grating, with pie cherry, sour raspberry and green olive flavors. Turns herbal to excess and finishes substandard.",Artist's Collection,80,10,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Salvatore Principe
21966,Argentina,"Hot and fiery at first, but then it tames itself while revealing jammy blackberry and roasted plum aromas.

22770,Argentina,"A mellow, pure Malbec, with soft, subtle aromas of graham cracker, licorice, blueberry and chocolate. The palate has a welcome freshness that melds acidity and ripe fruit into a correct whole, and the flavors of blackberry, spice, coffee and chocolate work great together. Just right for the money, with blackness, richness and balance. contains 90% Malbec with 9% Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot.",A Lisa,90,23,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
22774,Argentina,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic.

Drink now through 2012.",Synthesis,90,50,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
22804,Argentina,"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors. Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.",Reserva,88,29,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Altocedro
22819,Argentina,"Fiery, foxy and leathery on the bouquet, with a hint of latex in addition to ripe blackberry aromas. Feels round and fresh, with a complete mix of plum, berry and currant flavors. Finishes tight and legit, with good length and feel.",Felino,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Cobos
22820,Argentina,"A very oaky style of Malbec. The bouquet is full of cough drop, milk chocolate and mint, while the palate feels solid and beefy, but resiny. Flavors of berry fruits are softened and sweetened by oak and chocolate, while the finish is woody and tannic.",Gran Reserva,88,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Altocedro
22842,Argentina,"A touch raisiny but lusty and rich, with licorice, mint, black plum and fruitcake aromas. The palate is mouthfilling despite rather pointed acidity, and thus the flavors of juicy blackberry, cherry, pepper and coffee are accurate and appropriate. Long, toasty and yet again slightly raisiny on the finish. Drink now; 300 cases made.",Gran Reserva,90,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Cinco Sentidos
22872,Argentina,"A big wine that handles its 15.3% abv. Smells of pastry, earth and soft berry fruit. Feels round but reticent, with no fire or heat but plenty of blackberry, molasses and coffee. Mellow, toasty and blackened on the finish, with an earthy feel and a baked aftertaste.",,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Solsticio
22880,Argentina,"Sweet oak on the nose results in creamy, chocolaty aromas, along with herbal notes, plum and berry. Feels tight but expansive, with solid tannins, bright acids and solid flavors of herbs, berry fruit, cassis, toast and chocolate. Keeps it together on the finish.",Felino,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Cobos
22881,Argentina,"Perfectly good, but seemingly more simple and oily than in the past. Maybe that's just perception, but the perception is that this is a mild, tropically influenced wine with a fleshy body and mild aromas and flavors of lychee, green melon and lime. Finishes short and pithy.",,87,15,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Torrontés,Colomé
22885,Argentina,"Standard cherry and plum aromas create a straightforward bouquet. The feel is hot and choppy, but there's enough body and balance for it to weigh in properly.

22898,Argentina,"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.",Noemía,90,108,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
22900,Argentina,"Heavy and dark, with licorice, fruit syrup and blackberry pie aromas.

Drink now.",Gran Guarda,90,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Serrera
22907,Argentina,"Not many 2004 Argentine wines are still on the market, and yet this isn't showing any age. In fact, it's racy and a little sheering, with citric acidity that's keeping it fresh, firm, vital and lively. Flavors of zesty berry fruits come with a touch of oaky vanilla, but not too much. Very nice for a mature blend of Malbec and Merlot.",Encuentro,89,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Merlot,Felipe Rutini
22918,Argentina,"Jammy and dense on the nose, with herbal blueberry and prune aromas. This is powerful Malbec, with meaty, sweet flavors of black fruit, blueberry, dry spice and menthol.

There's a light note of toast on the finish.",,87,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alamos
22941,Argentina,"Smells cheesy and leathery, with herbal notes. Feels condensed and flat, as if it's collapsing on itself. Flavors of baked berry and prune are dark and typical of very ripe Malbec, while the finish is warm but basic in feel and flavor. Bullish, sweet and heavy. Not Colomé's best effort, especially given the price.",Reserva,87,90,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Colomé
22942,Argentina,"Opens with berry fruit aromas, density and slightly medicinal notes. Feels bright and lively, with ample acidity pushing toasty, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum.

22988,Argentina,"Concentrated aromas of blackberry come with leather and dried-cheese scents. The palate is full in depth and solid in feel, with flavors of creamy oak, medicinality and blackberry.

22989,Argentina,"Honest plum and berry aromas get it going, followed by a fresh, comfortable palate with raspberry and plum flavors and nonpushy tannins. Feels entirely clean, with a pleasant red-fruit aftertaste. Everyday Malbec that gets it right.",,87,8,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Arge & Tina
22996,Argentina,"Fresh, clean and pure, with standard dark berry aromas. Feels round, creamy and chewy, while the flavors tend towards black fruits and no shortage of oak.

23037,Argentina,"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff.

Finishes herbal and stalky, with a lingering green flavor.",Gran Las Divas Vineyard,87,32,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Riglos
23078,Argentina,"More subtle than your average full-force Malbec. This one runs heavy on the cedar, tobacco and rooty characteristics more so than black fruit and power, but there's ripe raspberry and chocolate to satisfy anyone seeking fruit and richness. A definite warm-climate wine, but it's restrained and traditional in style. I like this wine for its individuality.",Roble Reserva,89,18,Other,Argentina,,Malbec,Staphyle

Not exuberant on the finish; it ends in mellow, lightly medicinal fashion.",Colección,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alma del Sur
23109,Argentina,"Bright berry aromas are comported and good. Feels driving and forward, because of its bold acidity and choppy tannins, but tastes nice and dark, with blackberry and cassis flavors. There's a controlled burn to the finish, and overall the wine seems healthy.",Single Vineyard,87,18,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamadrid
23110,Argentina,"Dense and inky on the bouquet, with blueberry as the core fruit aroma and some grass or alfalfa around the edges.

Full on the finish, with coconut and oaky accents.",Single Vineyard,87,18,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Lamadrid

Lively and warm on the finish, with zest and an herbal element.",,87,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,N?made
23137,Argentina,"A funky, individual blend of Merlot and Malbec from the Salta region, with its ups and downs. The nose carries patented Salta aromas of herbs and green bean, but there's berry scents and oaky mocha to offset that. The palate is forward and shows choppy tannins, while it tastes sweet, herbal and dark. As stated, this is a wine with virtues and pitfalls.",Ciclos,88,30,Other,Salta,,Malbec-Merlot,Michel Torino
23138,Argentina,"Controlled on the nose by blackberry, mint, menthol and fire. Like the 2008, this is not the easiest road to run, but it is a blast of penetrating blackberry, boysenberry, heat, spice and dark minty length. Tasty but tough, with the roughness and quality meeting in the middle. Drink in a couple of years.",Don David Reserve,88,17,Other,Cafayate,,Tannat,Michel Torino
23153,Argentina,"Now at the end of its peak, this is showing mature lychee, melon and soft-fruit aromas along with citrus, mango and nectarine flavors.

23163,Argentina,"Heavy and brooding, which makes sense seeing that it weighs in at 15% abv. So while it's not exactly ringing with freshness and agility, it scores points for its full-bodied black plum and blackberry flavors, and the oak is well applied. A bit warm and baked, but still good.",Libertad Vineyards,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benegas
23164,Argentina,"Black fruit aromas and rubber on the nose. Feels good in the mouth, with proper weight and balance. Tastes ripe and fairly sweet; blackberry and dark plum flavors turn peppery with time. Easy to drink Malbec.",,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alberti 154

23193,Argentina,"A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.",Cadus Single Vineyard,88,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
23200,Argentina,"Dense, rubbery and solid in terms of black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it feels right and fades nicely, highlighting healthy, firm blackberry, black olive and herbal flavors.

23202,Argentina,"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.",Estate Bottled,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Dante Robino
23203,Argentina,"An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality. The nose features clove, wild flowers, leather and hot berry fruit aromas, while the feel is clacky and tannic, and the flavors a little baked and stewy. Raisin, heft and berry soup characteristics make this a ripe, full-bodied force to reckon with.",S,88,60,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder

Cleansing on the finish, with mild bitterness.",Family,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Salvatore Principe
23230,Argentina,"Basic apple and straw aromas are not that intense but are, at the very least, open and clean. Feels easygoing and nice, with acidity giving it a lift.

23233,Argentina,"Earthy and leathery on the bouquet, with a cooked, charred element. Feels drawing but solid, with choppy tannins and flavors of baked berries, herbs and charred oak. Finishes warm and meaty, with an herbal note.",,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Poesia
23237,Argentina,"Red berry, sweet cherry and ripe plum aromas come with a touch of leather.

23248,Argentina,"Fresh and a little confected-smelling, then more citrusy and snappy in the mouth, with pink grapefruit and citrusy flavors that make your lips pucker and your palate come alive. Crisp, zesty and well done for Argentine rosé.",La Flor Malbec,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Rosé,Pulenta Estate
23283,Argentina,"Fruity and friendly on the nose, with composure and solid aromas.

23296,Argentina,"On the nose, there's an early whiff of nail polish that resolves itself in jammy black fruit aromas.

Finishes grapy.",Killka Collection,86,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
23297,Argentina,"Fleshy peach, melon and pineapple aromas on the nose. Feels lifted and fresh, and decidedly not oaky, with citrusy orange and nectarine flavors. Fruity, round and easy on the finish.",Oak Cask,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,San Felipe
23303,Argentina,"Concentrated and dark upfront, with black fruit, coffee, chocolate and cheese aromas.

23307,Argentina,"Char and hickory override fruit on the bouquet, while the palate is full, round and falls into form with time in the glass.

23321,Argentina,"Despite all the graphics and obscure references on the front and back labels, this is ultimately a very good wine and a value among under-$15 Malbecs. The Three Thieves team has bottled a creamy, oak-rich Malbec with full red-berry, spice and cocoa flavors. It's soft, subtle and smooth, but tastes and finishes properly.",,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,The Show
23328,Argentina,"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Espiritu de Argentina
23332,Argentina,"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.",Remolinos Vineyard,87,20,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Finca Decero
23345,Argentina,"Smells sort of furry and earthy initially, with notes of graphite and woodspice.

23387,Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas and then the nose transitions to heft, prune and blackberry. The palate is good but feels a touch flat, with sweet, candied black-fruit flavors. Falls off some on the finish, which tastes slightly milky.

23415,Argentina,"It opens with raisin and stewed aromas, so its freshness is questionable.

Chunky on the back end, with heat on the finish",Phebus,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Fabre Montmayou
23449,Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",Ultra,87,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
23469,Argentina,"Mild and powdery smelling, with inviting tropical undertones. The palate mixes flesh with freshness, and the flavors of lychee, green melon and white pepper are straight from the textbook.

23490,Argentina,"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length.

23560,Argentina,"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine.

23576,Argentina,"Gummy, rough and huge, with woody aromas, muddled red fruit and a ton of kick. The palate is narrow and grippy, with tarry, concentrated blackberry and wild berry flavors. There isn't much body or complexity to it; it's full-force, tannic and raw. Shows why Petit Verdot isn't usually made into a varietal wine.",Remolinos Vineyard Mini Ediciones,86,35,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Petite Verdot,Finca Decero
23585,Argentina,"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeño, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas.

A respectable, honest take on Torrontés.",Desvario,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Tierra Colorada
23635,Argentina,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas.

23677,Argentina,"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good.

23700,Argentina,"Smells different than most, with blueberry, carob and exotic sandalwood. Takes a dive on the palate, where it's sweet, syrupy and flat, almost like prune juice.

23739,Argentina,"Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy, but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit.

23813,Argentina,"Shows a warm, baked bouquet with black fruit, licorice and toasty aromas. The palate, however, is high in acid, thus it churns and burns as it's offering bright, sheer berry flavors.

23815,Argentina,"Flowery and fresh on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate is smooth, not too demanding or rough, and tastes of papaya and green banana.

Highly regular, with nothing glaring or wrong.",Estate,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Medrano

23872,Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel.

23873,Argentina,"Simple aromas of lemon and lychee are just fresh enough, while the palate offers good feel and pithy, somewhat bland flavors of the same fruits that appear on the bouquet.

23877,Argentina,"Minty and earthy, with aromas of plum, rubber and herbs. The palate is straight down the middle in terms of feel, while the flavors turn brambly and herbal, something the finish matches. Basic and a little strained.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Filus
23879,Argentina,"Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.",,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andeluna
23952,Argentina,"Prickly red-fruit aromas open the show, and after that it's briary. The palate delivers a choppy feel along with herbal, briary fruit flavors and earthy soupiness.

24065,Argentina,"A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.",Vástago de Gea,83,15,Other,Argentina,,Sauvignon Blanc,Staphyle

24071,Argentina,"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice.

24091,Argentina,"Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish.

24110,Argentina,"Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come.

31628,Argentina,"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.",Reserva,84,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Viognier,Finca El Origen

31730,Argentina,"Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid.

32738,Argentina,"This is so heavy it's nearly a solid and not a liquid. Maximum ripeness is on display at all check points, especially the palate, which is syrupy, raisiny and viscous on the finish.

32743,Argentina,"This is a leathery, stalky type of Malbec with fierce acidity and a pinched mouthfeel.

33269,Argentina,"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine.

36616,Argentina,"This Torrontés smells round, leesy, soft and short on particular fruit aromas. Due to its age, this feels plump and low on edgy acidity. Powdery citrus and lime flavors end flat, with some burn. This is probably past its prime, but it's still in good shape to enjoy now.",Festivo,86,15,Other,La Rioja,,Torrontés,Monteviejo
36629,Argentina,"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.",Barrica 29,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Le Billoud
36633,Argentina,"A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.",Cadus Single Vineyard,88,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
36640,Argentina,"Dense, rubbery and solid in terms of black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it feels right and fades nicely, highlighting healthy, firm blackberry, black olive and herbal flavors. Meets the norms of a very good, commendable Malbec. 14,000 cases made.",Reserva,88,19,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Bodega del Fin del Mundo
36642,Argentina,"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.",Estate Bottled,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Dante Robino
36643,Argentina,"An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality. The nose features clove, wild flowers, leather and hot berry fruit aromas, while the feel is clacky and tannic, and the flavors a little baked and stewy. Raisin, heft and berry soup characteristics make this a ripe, full-bodied force to reckon with.",S,88,60,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
36696,Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",Don Nicanor,84,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Nieto Senetiner
36701,Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.",Saurus Select,84,17,Other,Patagonia,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder
36706,Argentina,"A touch tough and stemmy on the nose, but given the price it rates as positive. The body is medium and friendly, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry feature a peppery accent. Finishes crisp and fresh.",,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zarpado
36709,Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas. In the mouth, it's scratchy and spicy, with herbal berry fruit leading to a mildly bitter finish. Better than in the past, but still a compromised wine due to its minty, green characteristics.",Felino,84,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Viña Cobos
36710,Argentina,"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors.

36716,Argentina,"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum.

36916,Argentina,"Amazingly ripe and deep wine from 2004, so it's all that it's going to be. Thick and figgy aromas bring bacon, mint and cool, cushiony cola notes.

36993,Argentina,"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana.

36994,Argentina,Generic melon and peach aromas precede a slightly forced and sweet palate with melony flavors and some tail-end bitterness. The finish is creamy and shows vanilla as well as peach and toast notes. Very basic Chardonnay given the price.,,84,17,Other,Patagonia,,Chardonnay,Verum
37000,Argentina,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.",Natal,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alpamanta
37004,Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice.

37010,Argentina,"Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.",Reserve,83,19,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Pinot Noir,Salentein
37012,Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP.",,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodega Norton
37015,Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",Reserva,83,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Nieto Senetiner
37141,Argentina,"Light cherry and raspberry aromas come in front of a grabby rubbery palate. This tastes like salty plum, with little variation of that theme. A solid finish tastes exactly like what came before.",Altas Cumbres,85,13,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Lagarde
37160,Argentina,"Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors.

37211,Argentina,"Dense, inky and sweet on the nose, with cassis, melted Swiss chocolate and well-integrated spice aromas.

37271,Argentina,"Despite all the graphics and obscure references on the front and back labels, this is ultimately a very good wine and a value among under-$15 Malbecs.

It's soft, subtle and smooth, but tastes and finishes properly.",,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,The Show
37278,Argentina,"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Espiritu de Argentina
37282,Argentina,"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.",Remolinos Vineyard,87,20,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Finca Decero
37321,Argentina,"Slightly green and a touch mulchy. The palate offers a decent mix of red fruits, herbal flavors and leathery notes. Finishes salty and choppy, but overall it's not a bad wine for the price.",,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ambiente
37328,Argentina,"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.",Pietro Marini,83,13,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Bodega El Transito
37330,Argentina,"A touch soupy and leafy on the nose, with a green element as well. The palate feel is clacky and firm, with herbal berry and green finishing flavors. Better in terms of feel and structure than flavors and aromas; a marginal Cab from a cool year.",Grand Reserve,83,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piattelli
37334,Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous, and frankly it's just not very fresh or inviting. The mouthfeel suggests astringency, while the flavors are salty and earthy but not very fruity. Finishes with a leathery feel and tannic grab.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Hinojosa
37335,Argentina,"Heat and horseradish define the sharp, peppery bouquet. The palate is tannic and grabby, with leafy red-fruit flavors and an added dose of herbs and pepper.

A drawing tannic finish tastes stewy and woody.",Reserve,85,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Ferllen
37500,Argentina,"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin.

37555,Argentina,"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice.

37637,Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas and then the nose transitions to heft, prune and blackberry. The palate is good but feels a touch flat, with sweet, candied black-fruit flavors. Falls off some on the finish, which tastes slightly milky.

37754,Argentina,"This wine has showed no consistency over the years. This vintage is black and extracted with piercing inky blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's huge, chunky and grating.

37881,Argentina,"Deep and lush, with aromas of blackberry, cassis and coffee. This is actually a better, more balanced wine than the winery's Gran Misterio because it isn't over the top and overoaked. Flavors of mocha, coffee and mulled berry are on the money, while the chocolaty finish is smooth. Drink now due to low acidity.",Misterio,91,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra
37921,Argentina,"Smells like floor polish at first. Gets better with time, but still a weak wine of juicy acids, too much oak, not enough fruit and a grating finish. Does nothing to move the dial forward in terms of Argentine Chardonnay.",,80,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Budini
37922,Argentina,"Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.",Reserva,80,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fioravante

37969,Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",Ultra,87,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken

38190,Argentina,"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length.

38484,Argentina,"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose.

Grabby on the finish, with a mild acidic scour.",Ique,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
39410,Argentina,"Simple and dominated by red fruit and mild green aromas and flavors.

Good but not very interesting.",Broquel,85,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
39602,Argentina,"Built like a brick house, with ripe, red aromas. This isn't light and elegant in the Italian style; it's mega ripe, with a ton of cherry, spice, kick and chocolate.

40012,Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel.

40897,Argentina,"Smells like a burning hay stack, and otherwise it's neutral. The palate has heft but little else, and the flavors of baked apple run resiny and sweet.

41045,Argentina,"Early aromas of compost and leather settle on earthy and leathery, with briar and olive.

41221,Argentina,"Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish.

41247,Argentina,"Shows barely any color and then a hard, vapid, no-fruit bouquet. The mouthfeel is citric and the tastes range from lemon to lemon.

41249,Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",,80,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cinco Sentidos
41335,Argentina,"Big, chunky and dark on the bouquet, but not overly fruity and definitely not sweet and raisiny smelling.

41382,Argentina,"Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather.

42572,Argentina,"Dusty, big and leathery on the nose, with coconut and earthy berry fruit aromas. The palate on this Cabernet-led blend is lively and juicy, with staunch acids and savory, earthy flavors of cherry and raspberry along with spice.

42589,Argentina,"Dark, smoky and minty on the nose, with mocha and licorice in the backdrop.

42599,Argentina,"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete.

42810,Argentina,"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine.

42814,Argentina,"An elevated, higher-quality style of Patagonian Pinot Noir.

42831,Argentina,"As per usual, Toso's regular varietal Malbec is pleasing, honest and shows the variety in its best, affordable form. Meaty and rich on the nose, with an inky accent.

42889,Argentina,"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish.

43126,Argentina,"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering.

43431,Argentina,"An approachable, friendly Bonarda that avoids the grape's hard, tannic, rubbery tendencies.

Drinkable straight out; a good one for barbecue and burgers.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alamos
43437,Argentina,"Fully roasted and savory in its aromas, with rubber and a peanutty hardness to the bouquet.

43486,Argentina,"Seems like quality and character are slipping a bit on this Malbec, which a few years ago overdelivered but is now more average.

Perfectly good but not the gem it used to be.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
43494,Argentina,"A thick, dark and slightly raisiny nose features licorice and smoke. It's a full, beefy Malbec with herbal berry flavors and a finish that sweetens up like syrup but also gets more herbal. Powerful but more rustic than polished.",Estate,86,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Doña Paula
43498,Argentina,"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors.

43726,Argentina,"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex.

43781,Argentina,"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors.

43795,Argentina,"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors.

44023,Argentina,"Given that the number of good Argentine PGs can be counted on one hand, this one distinguishes itself.

Drink now.",XIV,87,16,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Pinot Gris,Pulenta Estate
44030,Argentina,"Bold berry, rubber and coffee aromas give this basic Malbec some style to work off. The palate has bounce and fullness, with ripe black cherry and cassis flavors.

44395,Argentina,"Dark, smoky aromas suggest prune, licorice, coconut and shoe polish.

This is a new wine for the American market from Bodega Colomé, and it needs work.",,82,17,Other,Salta,,Red Blend,Amalaya
46720,Argentina,"Rosy pink and good for warm-climate getaways this winter.

46733,Argentina,"Ultra-purple in color, with shallow aromas of pine, thistle patch and black fruit. It's blazing with acidity, which pulls everything in tight and firm.

46794,Argentina,"Creamy, sweet aromas of cola and cassis are more generic than compelling, while the palate is soft, creamy and sports flavors of mocha and syrupy dark fruit. Hints of marshmallow and root beer accent the wine's sweet berry DNA, while the finish is regular. Good but a little sweet and sticky.",,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaiken

Rudimentary Cabernet.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Avenue
47029,Argentina,"Light in color, with neutral semi-citric aromas that are clean but innocuous. Candied in the mouth, as if there's a bit of residual sugar in the wine.

48179,Argentina,Opens with slightly pickled apple and melon aromas. Next in line is an edgy palate of pickled apple and vinaigrette flavors. Very pithy and tasting of grapefruit late. Fairly heavy and aggressive for SB.,,82,20,Other,Neuquén,,Sauvignon Blanc,Alpataco
48231,Argentina,"Dark, dense and minty on the bouquet, which is sexy and magnetic. Saturated and jammy but still maintaining balance, and then a superconcentrated set of jammy blackberry flavors runs side by side with toasty oak and chocolate. Almost dessert-like on the finish. A very rich and modern style of Malbec.",Judas,92,90,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sottano
48237,Argentina,"Cola, mint, black fruit and chocolate combine to form the full package in Malbec aromatics. Runs a mile deep in the mouth, with concentration, tannic grip and ripe blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors. Peppery and chocolaty on the finish, with density and depth. Drink now through 2015.",,92,50,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Cayu
48239,Argentina,"Ripe and totally right, with an attractive aromatic combination of dark spice, lusty berry and blackness.

Drink now through 2014.",Reserve,92,38,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
48451,Argentina,"The funky stable welcomes a new breed of llama: Pinot Grigio. And like most of the other FL wines, it's acceptable to o.k. but not showing much in the way of quality. The nose is mealy and flat, while the palate has roundness and soft flavors of orange, grapefruit and white pepper.",,82,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Funky Llama
48456,Argentina,"Reduction, iodine and matchstick aromas cloud up the bouquet, while the heavy palate is both sweet and sour. In the grand scheme of things, this wine just isn't very good. It smells and tastes nothing like quality Chardonnay.",Reserve,81,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Chardonnay,Finca Sophenia
48459,Argentina,"Leafy and dull to start, with questionable freshness to the aromatics. More hard and tannic than you'd want, and herbal and tomatoey in the mouth. It even has a distinct salty, no-sugar finish. Where's the freshness?",,81,15,Other,Neuquén,,Pinot Noir,Areo
48463,Argentina,"In general we are big fans of Toso's value-priced reds, but not so much this sweet, pickled, soft rosé. Wet and wide, but with no spine. Already on a downward plane.",Rosé,81,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
48465,Argentina,"Crusty, inky and minty smelling, with additional earth, leaves and alcohol. A hard, rubbery, pruney style of wine that is tough and unexpressive. Think rough Montepulciano from Italy.",Finca La Linda,81,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Luigi Bosca
48467,Argentina,"Toasty oak aromas hint at something serious, but in the mouth it's a dud. Banana and resin flavors are all you get, and the mouthfeel is flat as a board. Overoaked and dull.",Felino,81,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Viña Cobos
48468,Argentina,"Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.",CJR Blanc de Blancs,80,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Reginato
48470,Argentina,"Candied, jammy aromas don't lead to much of anything. Grating, sour, weak stuff; tomato and bland plum flavors with sour acidity. Barely worth a splash.",Estate Bottled,80,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rio Seco
48526,Argentina,"A sniff is rewarded with sandalwood, dry spice and thick, jammy berry aromas. It's concentrated and well integrated on the palate, with ultraripe and sweet flavors of coconut, vanilla cream and berry fruit. Seems a touch flat and candied on the finish, with a final blast of sweetness.",Argentino,91,135,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
48534,Argentina,"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents. It's solid and textured in the mouth, with creamy oak flavors alongside sawdust, milk chocolate and sweet berry notes.

Alberto,91,52,Other,Patagonia,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
48794,Argentina,"A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet.

48841,Argentina,"Calm, foresty, complex and inviting on the bouquet, with catchy berry and spice aromas.

48850,Argentina,"A powerful wine offering a rush of berry and plum aromas offset by sandalwood and blueberry. Tight as a vise in the mouth, but not overly hard or tannic.

49385,Argentina,"After sinking the 2005 version of this wine for being discombobulated, this seems like a total turn-around. It's dense and jammy like the previous year, with similar toasted qualities. But it's also better balanced and mentally challenging, with flavors of black olive, baked berry fruit and earth.

49387,Argentina,"For a sense of class, elevation and style that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very much worth a go.

It is also layered, long and composed.",,89,14,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
49692,Argentina,"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.",Amorío,89,33,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tikal
49694,Argentina,"Weinert has always pushed the more traditional, less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice, cinnamon, wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy, with hints of tomato, herbs, raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine, with grabby tannins, but it should age well for another few years. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Gran Vino,89,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
49757,Argentina,"Concentrated black fruit aromas are subtle and don't push real hard. It's jammy, deep and soft in the mouth, with sweet tannins and even sweeter core berry flavors and oak.

49763,Argentina,"Supersaturated, so much so that it's opaque, with blackberry, horseradish and chocolate aromas. In the mouth, it's on the cusp of overextraction but manages to toe the line.

49991,Argentina,"More clean and relaxed than Chalten's 2006 Gran Reserva, this reserve-level Malbec shows generous red-fruit aromas in front of standard but totally pleasant blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors.

Sweet and very ripe late, with a touch of raisin as it fades away.",Benegas Lynch,89,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Franc,Benegas
50361,Argentina,"By Nicasia's high previous standards, this wine from a substandard vintage is lacking. After an opening of sweet berry aromas, cured meat and spice, it's very sweet and candied tasting, with milk chocolate and carob flavors along with unabsorbed oak.

50599,Argentina,"This wine purports to cause whiplash, supposedly because it's so good, hence the “HeadSnapper” name. And while that's not likely to take place, its blackberry, toast and brambly undercurrent give it character, while the finish is cushioned and long, albeit a touch oaky. Healthy and very much worth a look, even if it won't cause your head to snap.",The HeadSnapper,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Belgrano
50641,Argentina,"Rubbery smelling at first, then earthy cherry and stewed fruit aromas emerge. Juicy and a bit pointed in terms of acidity, so it shocks the palate and pierces the cheeks.

50658,Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet.

50666,Argentina,"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors.

50910,Argentina,"Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec.

Earthy and herbal leaning on the lengthy finish.",,88,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lagarde
50927,Argentina,"Given that Argentina is hardly SB country, this wine sticks out for its clarity, minerality and freshness. The nose offers lean lime and other citrus aromas.

50938,Argentina,"Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance.

51475,Argentina,"As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes.

51501,Argentina,"A mature, restrained wine with earth, leather, red pepper flake and dry fruit on the nose.

Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot.",Primera Zona,87,31,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mapema
51503,Argentina,"Always a good buy and always big and husky, Gascón is a saturated and dark wine but one with good balance and texture.

Quite good for a fat young Malbec.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón
51516,Argentina,"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors.

51738,Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas.

51799,Argentina,"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper.

51808,Argentina,"Needs some time to unwind but once it does it mixes bold, dark berry fruit with earth and chocolate. There's not a lot of layering, variety or nuance to this wine.

52081,Argentina,"Slightly sharp and salinic smelling at first, but soon it veers toward strawberry and raspberry, with hints of smoke and rusticity. Still, for the most part this is a basic New World Cabernet with familiar cherry and plum flavors backed by a touch of chocolate. Feels creamy and medium-bodied, with healthy tannins and acids. A nice everyday Cab that doesn't overstep its limitations.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
52097,Argentina,"A little sharp and angular, with a touch of cat pee on the nose. But with air and time this bubbly rises above the masses.

52130,Argentina,"Full and forward smelling, with generic, slightly hot berry aromas. Feels good and tight, with a firm structure and sweet, lush red berry flavors. Narrows down on the finish, focusing on ripeness and red fruit. Nothing sour or astringent here.",,87,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Filus
52135,Argentina,"Foxy aromas are in the lead, backed by milk chocolate, a pinch of volatility and minty berry. The feel is good, with candied, herbal flavors of sweet berry and cassis. Sweet, sturdy and still a bit foxy on the finish.",Estate Selection,87,27,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Chakana
52139,Argentina,"Lean and angular on the nose, with crisp cherry and rhubarb aromas. Surprisingly elegant in the mouth, with citrus notes, zesty raspberry, clean cherry and a lightness of being. Nice in an unassuming way, with a touch of complexity.",Malma,87,12,Other,Patagonia,,Pinot Noir,Bodega NQN
52288,Argentina,"Bodega Chacra is Piero Incisa's personal project in Rio Negro, Argentina. It is only Pinot Noir, made by esteemed winemaker Hans Vinding Diers. This wine from vines planted in 1932 is linear and intense to the core. It's an ageworthy specimen with fine acidity and a tight structure. Now, it's juicy and a little sharp, with piercing black cherry fruit and spice galore. Best to wait another year or two to begin drinking, and beyond that it may last for another 5-10 years if well cellared.",No. 32,94,120,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
52322,Argentina,"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity.

Drink now through 2014.",Gran Reserva,92,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tomero
52332,Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",,92,70,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cheval des Andes
52364,Argentina,"Consistent with prior vintages, this Malbec is a full-throttle wine with huge aromas of blackberry and cassis. This version is a bit more narrow and linear than in the past, but it's still excellent. Flavors of oak-based vanilla and coconut sit on top of vivacious berry fruit, while chocolate cake and coconut are the key flavors on a large, lusty finish. Drink through 2018.",Las Divas Vineyard Gran,92,35,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Riglos
52378,Argentina,"With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag. Despite being big and dark, the palate is juicy in feel. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are backed by chocolate and mocha, while the finish is deep and pure, with toasty notes and additional chocolate. Drink through 2018.",Unánime Gran Vino Tinto,92,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mascota
52387,Argentina,"Quite dark and crusty on the nose, with aromas of road tar and obvious oak. Tough but real on the palate, with big tannins and lip-smacking berry and cherry flavors. Shows more oak character and resin than necessary, and thus the fruit flavors don't fully stack up to such heavy wood. Still, it gets it right more than wrong.",,86,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
52397,Argentina,"A heavy, blocky wine with a dark color and aromas that lean toward raisin and reduced balsamic vinegar. The palate is quite full and slightly syrupy in feel, while the flavors are of boysenberry and dark, toasty oak. Finishes with even more crusty, espresso-like wood flavors, leaving displaced wood as the lasting impression.",Casa,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Marguery
52402,Argentina,"Aromas of cherry cough drop make the bouquet slightly medicinal, but beyond that it's solid and familiar. Moderate richness on the palate accompanies flavors of butter, strawberry and raspberry. Heat, wood resin and a touch of pickle work the finish. Good wine but it doesn't exactly go the extra mile.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Bodega Don Bosco
52412,Argentina,"Herbal aromas are balanced by plenty of red fruit character. It's tough and tannic in the mouth, so food is almost a must. Tastes of herbal berry and stewed plums, and that's followed by a roasted, herbal finish. Tough in feel but honest in flavor.",,87,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Franc,Lagarde
52422,Argentina,"Full, solid and dishing pretty aromas of blackberry, dark plum and mild spice. Sturdy in the mouth, with nice balance and above-average mouthfeel.

52622,Argentina,"Despite tough vintage conditions, Bodega Septima got this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat right. The nose is dark, solid and full of attractive black fruit and coconut aromas.

A chewy, rich and balanced wine; drink now through 2014.",Gran Reserva,91,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Septima
52643,Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas. Next in line is a chewy, dark palate of wild berry and earthy fruit flavors. Clean on the finish with a bit less acidity than its brothers, Altamira and Mirador. Drink now through 2015.",Finca Bella Vista,91,120,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer
52671,Argentina,"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.",Reserva,92,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Durigutti
52681,Argentina,"Light and waxy on the nose, with touches of custard, lychee and banana. This is not a driving, varietally convincing Torrontés, but it is balanced and refreshing. The flavors of melon and apple are solid, while the finish is quick but nice. Drink right away and it shouldn't be a disappointment.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
52684,Argentina,"Plump and fruity on the nose, but it also smells entirely familiar and generic. Like most Argentine Cabernets, this wine is tight, tannic and full of cassis and other berry fruits. What it's not is elegant, complex or different than the masses. If you like bold but basic berry flavors, tannic bite and chocolate on the finish, this is for you.",Remolinos Vineyard,85,21,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Decero
52696,Argentina,"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines.",Cuvée Speciale,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême
52697,Argentina,"Opens with mildly gassy, rubbery aromas that suggest reduction or brett. Once it airs out, however, it's a good, generic Cabernet with familiar flavors of black fruits, mocha and chocolate. It's a little herbal and lean across the palate and onto the finish, but for run-of-the-mill everyday Cab it does the trick.",Estate Bottled,85,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca El Portillo
52698,Argentina,"Standard plum and berry aromas provide a nice opening to this dark, solid Malbec that's a little zingy and racy at its core. Flavors of plum and berry are typical for a wine of this class, which finishes with burnt flavors and a final resting place of grainy oak.",,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Durigutti
52708,Argentina,"Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo
52864,Argentina,"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",No. 55,93,100,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
52973,Argentina,"Layered berry and cassis aromas are a bit scratchy and gritty. This Cabernet feels saturated, pure and deep; flavors of blackberry, cassis, prune and chocolate are ripe and generous, while the finish is mildly herbal in flavor, with good length and build. Drink through 2018.",Gran Reserva,91,38,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
52977,Argentina,"Ripe berry, cassis and grilled meat aromas presage a fresh, zesty palate with free-flowing acidity that pumps up cherry, red plum, cassis and loamy earth flavors. It stays fruity, stout and smooth on the finish. The wine is ripe and fully representative of Mendoza and winemaker Alejandro's Vigil's style.",,91,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Franc,El Enemigo
52990,Argentina,"A little cheesy and raw at first, with aromas of cement, mint and light berry fruit. The palate is sort of thin and dilute for Malbec, with an emphasis on zingy red fruit more than dense, rich black stuff. Turns jumpy and lean on the finish.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
52997,Argentina,"If you're looking for a pedestrian but true sparkling wine for under $10, this Chenin Blanc-based bubbly from Argentina is solid, a touch yeasty and dry. It tastes much like a Loire Valley sparkler, with baked apple, apricot and peach pit flavors. On the negative side, it's fairly foamy across the tongue and doesn't have a top-grade mouthfeel.",South Extrême Extra Brut,84,8,Other,Argentina,,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême
53008,Argentina,"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat. Furthermore, there's rhubarby sourness at the core. Has its moments but needs more work.",Celestina Rosé of Malbec,84,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Reginato
53015,Argentina,"Stout and dense from the beginning, with blackberry and violet aromas. Despite being a bold and dark Malbec, this is fresh and composed, with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Good on the finish, with candied fruit and caramel sweetness.",,87,13,Other,Patagonia,,Malbec,Ruta 22
53016,Argentina,"Opens with tire rubber, char and minty, smoky black fruit. Feels mostly fresh and bold, with blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors. Just dense, sweet and spicy enough, with espresso bitterness to the finish. Composed and competent value red wine.",Trumpeter,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Syrah,Rutini
53030,Argentina,"Black and jammy on the bouquet, with a spot of minty green and licorice. It's softy and leans toward syrupy, with sweet, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Feels creamy and a little low on acidity, so drink soon.",,87,17,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antucura
53031,Argentina,"Black in color, with minty aromas of blackened berry, leather and a slight horsey funk.

Finishes soft and smooth, with mild tannins and sweet café mocha flavors.",,87,17,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Malbec,Antucura
53036,Argentina,"Shockingly good for $10 Argentine Pinot. It's easy on the nose, with milk chocolate and raspberry aromas.

Dry, spicy and honest on the finish.",Momentos del Valle,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Gouguenheim Winery
53193,Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity.

Drink now through 2013.",Apartado,91,70,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Felipe Rutini
53198,Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,91,90,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Colomé
53255,Argentina,"This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.",Estate,91,30,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Colomé
53256,Argentina,"A blend of Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot, Centenario offers spicy, herbal black-fruit aromas along with tea leaf, animal notes and a bit of green. The palate is chunky and ripe in feel, with soft tannins. Flavors of toasted berry, coffee, bitter chocolate and green herbs finish comfortably. Drink through 2018.",Centenario,91,36,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finca Perdriel
53281,Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, but also fairly scattered and unfocused. The feel is nice and the bubble bead is right on. But the flavors are centered around dull apple, and there seems to be a salinic element that makes everything taste a little salty.",Extra Brut,84,12,Other,Argentina,,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême
53286,Argentina,"An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.",Organic,84,10,Other,Famatina Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pircas Negras
53296,Argentina,"Fiery and crisp, with decent berry and cherry aromas giving it character. The palate is medium to racy, with zesty raspberry, cherry and rhubarb flavors. Finishes short and a little prickly, with heat and a hint of chocolate. Very basic, but by no means a bad wine.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tercos
53298,Argentina,"There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.",Premium,84,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
53306,Argentina,"Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.",Premium Extra Brut,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alta Vista
53308,Argentina,"Can't say that sparkling wines and whites are Toso's strong suit. This Pinot Noir-based wine is tan in color and smells and tastes a lot like carbonated Sherry. Flavors of dull citrus and nuts work the palate, while the finish is controlled but not all that lively.",Extra Toso Extra Brut Reserve Sparkling,83,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Pascual Toso
53483,Argentina,"Generous, sizable aromas of cassis, blackberry and violet are inviting. This is juicy, with slightly wiry acidity creating a racy mouthfeel.

53536,Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
53547,Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort.

Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.",Morena,90,30,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Blend,Viña Alicia
53580,Argentina,"Ginger ale aromas and a foamy, gassy burn give this bubbly a personality similar to soda pop. The flavors are rather tart and green, with a note of green bean. Tastes and feels more narrow and vegetal than desired. On the plus side, it gets better the more it sits and the more you get to know it.",Blanc de Blancs,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Reginato

53593,Argentina,"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",,83,29,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer
53594,Argentina,"Fairly herbal, with burnt briar aromas that cause it to tilt toward acrid. The palate shows mostly tart cranberry and wild berry flavors, and while it looks dark to the eye, the wine is surprisingly shallow and a little bit sharp in the end run.",Año Cero,83,17,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Altocedro
53598,Argentina,"Las Moras is from Argentina's La Rioja region, and Black Label aims to be its top product. But mostly the wine pushes minty, dark oak on top of superficial plum and berry fruit. It's extremely wooded, so the finish deals mint chip and raw wood flavors. A racy and sheer mouthfeel doesn't exactly help it along.",Black Label,83,18,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
53600,Argentina,"Quite generic and arguably overoaked given the wine's core quality. The nose smells rubbery and then milky, while the palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, candied, oaky fruit flavors. In our opinion it's too resiny and done up in woodspice, and thus the fruit never shines. Not nearly as good as Toso's basic Malbec.",Maipú Vineyards,83,14,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
53605,Argentina,"Simple raspberry and cherry aromas carry rubbery side notes and a touch of floor polish. The palate is lean and generic, with red-fruit flavors and citrusy acidity. Modest, zesty and not much to it.",Elsa,83,9,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
53639,Argentina,"Rubbery aromas vie with solid berry fruit notes. The palate is basic and a touch edgy in feel, with red plum, currant and herbal flavors. Peppery and minty on the finish, but juicy and correct overall.",Altas Cumbres,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
53818,Argentina,"Tightly wound aromas of rubber and black fruits preview a rubbery, fruity palate that's generous in its delivery of vanilla, creamy berry, black plum and cassis flavors.

53839,Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins. As Bonarda goes, this is a clear winner; it's blowsy and ribald on the nose, with tons of black fruit, coconut and mocha. The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Limited Edition Reserva,90,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Nieto Senetiner
53843,Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Carrascal,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
53881,Argentina,"Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens.

Basically this is a light-bodied quaffer that seeks not to offend.",Elsa,83,9,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
53893,Argentina,"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.",Extra Brut,82,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Trapiche
53901,Argentina,"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts. It's not awful but it's the kind of wine that does nothing but fall apart once the cork is pulled.",,81,7,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Torrontés,Bodega Don Bosco
53903,Argentina,"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch.",,80,12,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Torrontés,Pascual Toso
53904,Argentina,"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Gran Reserva,80,18,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Origen
53915,Argentina,"Opens with clean, standard tropical fruit aromas. The palate follows suit with a tight mouthfeel and tropical flavors of melon, baNAa and peach, all accented by a spot of vanilla.

54114,Argentina,"This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality.",Finca Los Turcos,90,35,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Altocedro
54115,Argentina,"The nose offers both minerally crispness and full-fledged black-fruit aromas.

54122,Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15.

A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Serie Magno Gran Reserva,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Fantelli
54131,Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet.

54234,Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a citrusy element, green notes and something muddy. For a big Malbec with a full price tag, it leaves me wondering: It's chunky and tastes of red berry, citrus, pineapple and marshmallow. Jumbled and sweet on the finish. Has enough good in it not to tank but it's not in full harmony.",,86,28,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca 8

The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors.

54422,Argentina,"Earthy, gritty aromas of asphalt mix with fruitier notes of cherry and plum to form an attractive, harmonious nose. This Cabernet is pure and light on its feet; flavors of coffee, cola and dried red fruits finish with elegance and femininity. Drink through 2016.",Vineyard Selection,90,27,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hubert Weber
54513,Argentina,"Smells barbecued and saucy, with dry oak, resin and smoked meat aromas. The palate is more acidic, while the flavors lean toward resiny and saucy, i.e. hickory and roasted berry. Oaky on the finish, with sawdust and vanilla flavors.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Colores del Sol
54521,Argentina,"Minty, floral aromas veer toward darker notes of cola, forest floor and leather. The palate is medium-full, with grabby tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry mixed with herbs and spice. A regular, oaky style of Cabernet with a raw, grabby mouthfeel.",Gran Lurton,86,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,François Lurton
54538,Argentina,"Opens with aromas of mint and latex, then the oak rises up, leaving vanilla and sawdust scents. Dry tannins and good size set up a minty-tasting flavor profile with resin and wild berry flavors. Finishes with anise and licorice, and just enough acidity to keep it balanced.",Elevated,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,High Note
54665,Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Atemporal,89,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alta Vista
54675,Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Serie A,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
54680,Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",,89,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Siesta
54745,Argentina,"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.",Reserva,90,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
54749,Argentina,"Minerally and firm on the nose, it bursts with blackberry and plum aromas. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber. A saucy, leathery, meaty-tasting finish is friendly in feel.",Premium,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
54818,Argentina,"Very red and slightly grassy on the nose, with aromas of strawberry, mint leaf and rhubarb. It's a juicy screamer in the mouth, with intensity, blazing acidity and wild raspberry and plum flavors. Dry, tight and long on the finish.",La Madras Vineyard,86,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ricardo Santos
54829,Argentina,"The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vintage Sun
54835,Argentina,"A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.",Apartado Gran,85,70,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Felipe Rutini
54839,Argentina,"Rubbery, bold and earthy on the nose, then full and sticky in the mouth, with sweet black fruit flavors.

Tastes good but could use a lesson in elegance and restraint.",,85,17,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Pinot Noir,Antucura
54990,Argentina,"Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors.

54991,Argentina,"Los Tanos hails from La Consulta in the Uco Valley, as does its brothers, Los Turcos and Los Gallegos. As stated in the Turcos and Gallegos reviews, these wines are triplets in terms of their oaky, creamy, sweet characteristics and overt richness.

55041,Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed.

Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Gran Misterio,89,80,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra
55120,Argentina,"Sweet aromas of sugar cookie come with a pinch of citrus fruit. The mouth is plump, with just enough citric acidity to keep it together.

Drink immediately; it's starting to fade.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Vintage Sun
55284,Argentina,"An elegant, floral Pinot Noir from Patagonia's top producer of PN. Barda is warm, creamy and intense. An emphasis on balanced raspberry and cherry flavors mixed with rose hip and freshness gives it an Old World personality. A very drinkable and honest style of red wine. Good now into 2011.",Barda,90,24,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
55320,Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly.

Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Corte B,89,23,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
55328,Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha.

55334,Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit.

55335,Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors.

55337,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Eolo,89,79,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Trivento
55348,Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Obra Prima Coleccion,88,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Cassone

Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.",Andean Culture,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Maipe
55606,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Brote Negro,88,100,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
55612,Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas.

56174,Argentina,"Opens with candied, chocolaty aromas that contradict its age. In the mouth, it's mature although the structure is breaking up; nonetheless, it's interesting and attractive, with herb, raspberry, tea, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Overall it's a different breed, and despite having lost its structure it's sly and well worth a go. Drink now.",Filósofos,88,60,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Red Blend,Viña El Cerno
56175,Argentina,"A nice, clean, fairly complex white is what this is. The nose is all lychee and jasmine, and it's not at all heavy or oily.

56184,Argentina,"Graham cracker is the lead aroma, and that's followed by jammy fruit, cookie dough and finally a touch of raisin.

57017,Argentina,"A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect.

A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.",Reservado,88,16,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
57026,Argentina,"For a tough, cool vintage, this wine displays lush qualities and depth, bordering on jamminess. Flavors of baked plums and cassis rest on a plump, soft palate with little tannic bite. All in all, it may be a little overripe, which is why the finish is short. But as a whole this is a tasty wine, especially considering the year.",,88,19,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Marchiori & Barraud

Easygoing as they come, with a hint of sweetness on the finish.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Tilia
57334,Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas.

57369,Argentina,"Raisiny black-fruit aromas are jammy and a clarion indicator of what's to come. In the mouth, this Malbec is saturated and chunky, with extreme ripeness.

The finish is earthy, heavy and rich but short on vibrancy.",Reserva,88,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton

57651,Argentina,"Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full.

57653,Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate.

58201,Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this.

58207,Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas.

Straightforward blackberry flavors come with little to no complexity, while the finish is quick and fades away with modest grip and length.",Reserve,88,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
58282,Argentina,"Big aromas of blackberry and raspberry feed into a full, fresh and ultimately standard palate with grapy blackberry flavors that show a controlled herbal side. Toasty and a touch bitter on the finish, it has a minty aftertaste.",Leo,88,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
58283,Argentina,"Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk.

58494,Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency. Deep as midnight in terms of flavors, with black fruits galore setting up a richly packed, ultraripe finish. New World to the max but very tasty and rich.",Barrancas Vineyards Alta Reserve,91,36,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Pascual Toso
58512,Argentina,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber.

Very good for value-priced Argentine CS.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
58579,Argentina,"Ripe plum and berry aromas come with spice notes before a supremely generous palate that's loud and flavorful in blackberry, cassis and black cherry fruit. On the finish, chocolate and oak influences roll in as the tannins subside. For power, flavor and clarity, this is a sure bet.",,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alamos
58585,Argentina,"Spicy, dry aromas of earth, red currant and black olive offer some complexity and style. This is full bodied, racy and loaded with black cherry, cassis and peppery spice flavors. A touch of heat and menthol adds jolt to the finish.",,88,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sottano
58588,Argentina,"Standard berry aromas come with notes of leather and animal. This is firm, clacky and shows biting tannins, while the flavor profile revolves around herbal blackberry with a pinch of salt.

58816,Argentina,"Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas.

58820,Argentina,"Warm and generous on the nose, with hints of brick dust and herbal strawberry fruit.

Works well, although it worked better when it was an under-$10 wine.",Urban Uco,87,14,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
58829,Argentina,"Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.",Zeta,87,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Zuccardi
58867,Argentina,"This Malbec from a cool vintage opens with a mix of gritty plum and jammy berry aromas. In the mouth, it's deep enough but compact.

A mild finish makes it an easy drinker.",Saurus Select,88,19,Other,Patagonia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
59118,Argentina,"Opens with a slight chemical-smelling topping to berry, raisin and cheesy aromas. The palate is chunky on one hand and driving on the other, with berry and raisiny flavors.

59149,Argentina,"Big and nice, with bacon, rubber and espresso aromas. There's a lot of color and heft to this Malbec, which belies the vintage to an extent.

Pretty deep given that 2007 was an abnormally cool year in Mendoza.",,87,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tapiz
59158,Argentina,"A standard but well-done red blend. The nose deals lively plum and blackberry aromas, but also a slight hint of pickle. It's juicy and ripe-feeling on the palate, where red-fruit flavors of plum, cherry and raspberry are dominant. Solid and warm on the finish, and healthy and honest overall.

59403,Argentina,"Pungent aromas of citrus range from lemon to orange, and there's also an oily element to the bouquet.

59666,Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs.

59677,Argentina,"Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis.

59731,Argentina,"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather.

60142,Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy.

60320,Argentina,"A nice step up from previous vintages; this affordable Syrah sports dark-fruit aromas and muscle, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry. Not a tannic, spicy, complex wine; instead it's easy as pie.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Finca El Portillo
60321,Argentina,"A better overall ride than the more oaky Koch Cabernet, this bottling, aged 13 months in barrel, is crisp and fruity, with firm tannins that clamp down on the finish.

61748,Argentina,"Ripe, bulky and fruity, with simple, granular aromas. The mouthfeel is full and warm, but generally speaking the balance is where it's supposed to be. Smooth and chocolaty across the palate and onto the finish. Shows power and density.",,85,10,Other,La Rioja,,Syrah,Ichanka
61759,Argentina,"Aromas of melon and baby powder are light but attractive, while the peach and citrus flavors are wet, zesty and fresh. Finishes with dried-fruit flavors and a sprinkle of minerality. Commendable for its simplicity.",,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Lurton
61760,Argentina,"Light strawberry aromas lead the way, with a touch of almond candy as background. The palate is fruity but nondescript, with tangy acidity and good mouthfeel. This is a perfectly competent rosé, especially for Argentina, which isn't really known for the style.",Volta,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Rosé,Terza
61765,Argentina,"Quite basic and innocuous. The nose offers simple berry and plum, but nothing exciting. The palate is earthy, fruity and solid; but again, nothing out of the ordinary.

61777,Argentina,"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend.

Drink now through 2012.",,92,75,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cheval des Andes
61787,Argentina,"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now.",Primum,92,64,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
61792,Argentina,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages.

61843,Argentina,"Until now all we've tried are Callia's basic $9 varietals. So this is a big step up in intention, price and power. The bouquet is compact and sweet, with coconut, juniper and foresty aromas. Fresh and slightly grating on the palate, with spunky raspberry and cocoa. Turns more raw and rough as it expands, but overall we like this blend of Shiraz, Tannat, Malbec and Merlot.",Grand Callia,88,43,Other,San Juan,,Red Blend,Callia
61854,Argentina,"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring.

Quite good for ten bucks.",Sensual,88,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi

61862,Argentina,"Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins.

61954,Argentina,"Argentinean Tempranillo is a slippery slope, as evidenced by this mossy, olive-ridden red that has its moments as well as its faults.

Imported by Dourthe USA.",Red Wine,89,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Clos de los Siete

62268,Argentina,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality.

62276,Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity. A blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Alto,91,80,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alta Vista
62279,Argentina,"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance. Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.",Ultra,91,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
62321,Argentina,"There's a mix of good and questionable here. The nose starts out gaseous and stinky, as if it's begging for air. Give it time and it settles on exotic, warm blueberry and floral aromas. The palate is downright syrupy and thick, with licorice, bitter chocolate and sweet berry flavors.

62434,Argentina,"Year after year I taste this wine, and it always seems oaky and short on fruit. That said, it's a balanced, serious wine from well-tended vines, and it's made by folks who care.

62450,Argentina,"A typical New World Chardonnay in that it starts with corny aromas that are matched by heavy toast notes. Act two is an ultra sweet palate that seems more sugary than ideal. Very tropical as well, with sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Too sweet to be convincing as a dry white.",Reserve,83,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Zolo

64030,Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",Amado Sur,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,White Blend,Trivento

It's bigger and more dense than its younger brother, No. 55, but maybe a tad less elegant and a bit more cellar worthy.

65121,Argentina,"Gold in color and on the dry, waxy side. Shows mineral and dried fruits on the nose, with heavy pear and apple bulking up the palate. Finishes short, with some pithy bitterness. But good overall, with a roundness that's appealing. Imported by South Valley Wines.",,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Novus
65126,Argentina,"A little bit of bramble and green  on the nose, but by and large this wine is solid.

Imported by Victoire Imports.",Crianza,85,10,Other,Argentina,,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Huberto
65167,Argentina,"Light, tropical but ultimately dilute, with chalky, drying, tart flavors that run toward lemon and underripe pineapple. Lemony on the finish and monotone.",,82,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Funky Llama
65168,Argentina,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.",,82,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Funky Llama
65173,Argentina,"Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors. Finishes heavy, and overall it seems to be on an early fade.",Festivo,82,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Monteviejo
65174,Argentina,"Maybe this wine is already past its prime, but given that we aren't that familiar gauging barrel-aged blends of Sauvignon Vert, Pinot Gris, Chard and Torrontés, all we can say is that it comes across odd, resiny and heavy. Barrel notes and mustard flavors aren't all that great, and overall it's chunky, soft and tastes strange.",Gran Lurton Corte Friulano,82,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,White Blend,François Lurton

65180,Argentina,"Much of what's wrong with Argentinean Chard is on full display here. The nose is stalky, hot and oily, with little freshness of fruit. And the mouth is hot and grating, with stemmy, bitter apple and citrus flavors. Tolerable on a good day, but is this really what the consumer wants?",Trumpeter,82,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
65184,Argentina,"Vanilla and a dusty hollowness define the nose, and then comes an extremely sweet and sugary palate that almost makes your teeth and jaws hurt. Very sweet and unctuous, and thus it's to be avoided if dry whites are all you drink.",Reserve,81,12,Other,Argentina,,Torrontés,Alto 3
65220,Argentina,"Congratulations go to Schroeder for having the guts to blend Pinot Noir and Malbec, and to get a great wine out of it.

65255,Argentina,"The nose bears a strong resemblance to canned fruit, particularly peaches. The palate offers some zesty nectarine and even more fruit cocktail.

65259,Argentina,"Chunky and on the verge of overripe, with soft peach and melon aromas. Additional peach and melon flavors define the overweight palate, while the finish is heavy but flavorful.

65313,Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",Felino,81,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Viña Cobos
65314,Argentina,"Off the grid in terms of aromas, which hint at blueberry and candy but don't seem right or familiar. The palate is grainy and jammy, with raisiny flavors as well as souring acidity. Herbal and then bland on the short finish.",Dos por Cuatro,81,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andes Grapes

65321,Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose.

65331,Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",Nicasia Vineyard,97,120,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65343,Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction. It tastes very good, with pure, less than bashful plum and cola flavors leading straight to a fruity, lasting finish. This may not have much sauvage, old world Syrah character; but for Argentina it's made right and registers from head to toe.",,90,14,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Syrah,Pascual Toso
65352,Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas. Despite slightly crisp acidity, the wine is lusty and giving, with juicy cherry, cassis and other bright-flavored fruit. Good length and some chocolate on the finish send it away in fine form. 550 cases made.",Gran Reserva,89,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Ca' de Calle
65355,Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way. But once it settles, the oak supports classy blackberry, boysenberry and peppery flavors along with a structured, dense mouthfeel.",Gran Reserva,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
65356,Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",Iscay,89,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot-Malbec,Trapiche

65392,Argentina,"Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda.

A yummy, well-made wine.",Estate Selection,90,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Chakana
65412,Argentina,"Simple and floral; not concentrated. This lightweight is tasty enough and overall it's balanced. The palate deals citrus, melon and crispness, and the feel is lively and juicy. Tastes more like Spanish Albariño than Chardonnay.",,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
65474,Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action.

Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.",Argentino,95,120,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65476,Argentina,"Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015.",Viña Federico Villafañe Single Vineyard,95,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
65487,Argentina,"From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec.

Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Viña Adriana Venturin Single Vineyard,94,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
65490,Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Catena,89,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
65504,Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive.

65505,Argentina,"An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas. It's a little saucy and saturated, but with air it unveils layering and flavors of coconut (oak-based), leather, cassis and plum. Rich on the finish, with chocolate and rubber notes. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Catena Alta,89,57,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata

65566,Argentina,"Moderately fruity on the nose, with a hint of leafiness and pickle. Raspberry and strawberry flavors are generally sweet, while the feel is a bit on the sharp side. Simple and straightforward, but with hardly any recognizable Shiraz character.",,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Funky Llama
65567,Argentina,"So woody at first you'd think you had entered a sawmill, but with time it settles down. Red berries, milk chocolate and wood spice work the palate, followed by lean fruit leftovers and vanilla.",Zagal,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hacienda del Plata
65573,Argentina,"Pickled at first, while oak comes on strong as it airs out. The palate shows a lot of butter and toast, with only mild fruit hanging out in the background. Dry and short in the long run.",Saurus Patagonia Select,83,13,Other,Argentina,,Chardonnay,Familia Schroeder
65574,Argentina,"Ordinary plum and berry aromas to start, followed by a more jammy palate that tastes of berry compote. A touch of chocolate and pepper carry the finish. All totaled this is decent wine with middle-of-the-road characteristics.",,83,11,Other,San Juan,,Shiraz,Graffigna
65657,Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",,89,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Dante Robino
65662,Argentina,"Sweet blackberry fruit and minerally darkness give this Malbec a smooth, inviting bouquet.

Among the best values in Argentina.",Select,89,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
65700,Argentina,"Speechless at first as the nose offers very little. The mouth offers basic dark fruit with some tannins. Grabby at first, but better as it opens up. Rubbery but fairly ripe.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
65701,Argentina,"Starts with apple covered in oak-based caramel and vanilla, but loses its focus as it evolves. The palate is a mishmash of melon, citrus and papaya, while the overall take is that its less than stellar but not offensive. In this case, the organic qualifier isn't a boost.",Organica,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
65706,Argentina,"Ripe, jammy and forward, with very little besides heavy berry fruit to offer. The palate is overtly oaky, with butter and wood notes. Grapy and a raw in the middle, with some displaced tannins.",Saurus Patagonia,83,9,Other,Argentina,,Merlot,Familia Schroeder
65721,Argentina,"A big blast of oak rises up from the glass, a barrier to what fruit might lie below. Once you get to the palate, there's tight but somewhat tart raspberry and a touch of leather. Not nearly as ripe and rich as the oak on the nose calls for; thus the end result is almost sour, which isn't an attribute when it comes to Malbec.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Trumpeter
65729,Argentina,"Roasted and deep at first, which is encouraging. But it doesn't really stand the test, showing tart plum and berry flavors, out-of-place tannin and shortness on the palate. Finishes too thin and hard.",Grand,82,21,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Joffré e Hijas
65773,Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful.

Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,120,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65786,Argentina,"Another well-polished Malbec from Trapiche's single-vineyard series. This one, from Tupungato in the Uco Valley, is the most “red” of the '06s. The fruit is juicy and bursts with acidity and power. Cherry, red plum and cassis are the lead flavors, and it finishes on a bed of chocolate and peppery spice. Good now but will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",Viña Cristina y Bibiana Coletto Single Vineyard,92,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
65794,Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy.

Rich and ready to drink now.",Old Vine,88,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Tierra Divina
65822,Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so.

65825,Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity.

Nice in this price range.",Saurus Patagonia Select,89,14,Other,Neuquén,,Chardonnay,Familia Schroeder
65836,Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate. A rich, almost medicinal wine, the type that can often cost $50. And here it's $9. Weighs in at 14.6%, so it should have its fans.",,89,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Terra Buena
65841,Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla.

65846,Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket.

This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",Oak Cask,89,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
65852,Argentina,"Heavy and flat, with dull apple aromas. The palate delivers simple yellow fruit, while the finish is soft and devoid of spunk. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this wine; it's a cipher.",,82,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Big Daddy Vineyards
65853,Argentina,"Good color but the nose and palate don't offer that Cabernet lushness that most of us seek. The red-fruit nose is kind of lean, probably a reflection of Patagonia's cool climate. And the palate is peppery and starchy, with hard tannins.",Saurus Patagonia,82,9,Other,Argentina,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
65859,Argentina,"Light and candied, with strawberry drink mix as the main aroma. In the mouth, it's rather sticky and sweet, with basic characteristics. Adequate in terms of feel and balance.",,82,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Funky Llama
65864,Argentina,"Not a whole lot to say about the soft, flat nose. It's o.k., but that's really about it. The palate, meanwhile, turns sweet, nearly to the point of candied. And the finish is downright sugary. Decent weight and feel help it along.",,82,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Zolo
65866,Argentina,"Jumbled, with sweet, soft fruit that is sugary and quite strange. Not exactly off the mark but a hard wine to like. It's sweet and candied and unfocused.",,81,8,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,SolAlto

65874,Argentina,"Round, red, ripe and rubbery. It weighs in at 14% but seems like a mystery wine when tasted blind. Yields little Pinot character but as generic red wine it's acceptable. Tastes mostly of anonymous berry and chocolate.",Saurus Patagonia Select,81,13,Other,Argentina,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder

65921,Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively.

Nicely focused and forward; probably what most people are looking for from Argentinean Malbec.",Reserva,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
66121,Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Don David Reserve,88,15,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
66123,Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Selección de Bodega Single Vineyard,88,35,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
66125,Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is lively courtesy of vivid core acidity, while the berry and cherry flavors come across ripe and grabby. The more air you give it the better it'll perform. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Reserva,88,23,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
66126,Argentina,"Open and rewarding, with strawberry and raspberry aromas followed by ripe, clean cherry and raspberry flavors. Don't expect a ton of depth or richness, but do expect a food-friendly wine that's convincing and well made.",Saurus Patagonia Select,88,14,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Familia Schroeder
66132,Argentina,"Soft, easy and totally ripe, this easygoing blend of Cabernet and Merlot should win over most consumers because it's a friendly sort that's endowed with cola, plum and abundant richness. Opponents may find it soft and mealy, but no matter where you stand it should be drunk as soon as possible. Imported by SWG Imports.",Dos Fincas,88,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Carlos Basso
66133,Argentina,"Here and there you'll find a very well-made Argentine Viognier because the country's warmth and the grape can go together. A case in point is this plump, lush specimen that sports developed lemon and orange flavors and a long, acid-propelled finish.",Finca La Linda,88,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Viognier,Luigi Bosca
66136,Argentina,"Concha Y Toro's Argentine property seems to be getting it right with Malbec. This affordable number is dark and dense, with plum and prune on the nose and concentrated berry flavors on the palate. For a meaty, structured, fully oaked Malbec, Trivento is the call. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Select,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
66146,Argentina,"If you'd like a little character, bramble and spice to your Cab, then this is where you should go. Yes, it starts out with leather, pickle barrel and a lot of bramble bush, but every time you go back to it there's more fruit, polish, complexity and style. It's interesting, ripe and a step up from your basic street-level Cabernet.",Cruz Alta Reserve,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Escorihuela
66216,Argentina,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Manos,91,90,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
66226,Argentina,"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made.",Brote Negro,91,86,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
66249,Argentina,"Good from the beginning, with deep berry aromas touched up by mocha, vanilla and road tar. The palate of cassis, black fruit and light herbs is juicy and lively, and while the finish is standard in terms of feel and length, it offers oak-driven coconut and spice flavors.",Selección,88,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alamos
66256,Argentina,"This unusual marriage of Pinot Noir and Malbec has a familiar set of aromas and flavors. There's raspberry, tobacco and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate tastes of blackberry and tobacco, with some sweetness. Not pushy, a little strange, and overall very good.",S,88,60,Other,Neuquén,,Red Blend,Familia Schroeder
66258,Argentina,"This is the kosher version of Gran Malbec made by Flechas, and it's concentrated and rich, with an oily sort of feel along with fairly soft tannins. Aromas of roasted fruits hint at the olive, baked plum and tempered herb flavors that come later, and the finish is thick and chewy. A broad, succulent but shy Malbec. Drink now.",Kosher Gran,88,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Flechas de los Andes
66269,Argentina,"The nose is full of mellow raspberry and cherry, while the palate is fleshy and round, with blackberry and a touch of raisin. Plump, not edgy, and ready to drink, with coffee and mocha notes on the finish.",Organica,88,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
66278,Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",Finca La Linda,88,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
66285,Argentina,"Interesting Argentine Cabernet, with rooty, baked aromas that settle in and impress if given time. The palate is balanced by subtle red-fruit and earthy flavors, while the feel is stocky and grabby courtesy of strong tannins. A good wine with a lot of positives.",,88,17,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
66288,Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Calvulcura,88,25,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Antucura
66293,Argentina,"Full, serious and ripe, with leather, animal and an underside of savory oak and bacon. Typical of the house style, the wine is lush and jammy, with syrupy black-fruit flavors setting up a composed, rich finish. Best for fans of hefty, New World reds.",Winemaker's Selection,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andeluna
66392,Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.",Ciclos,88,26,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec-Merlot,Michel Torino
66400,Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha. Ripe and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but that said, it teeters on the verge of being syrupy. Best if you like creamy New World reds.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
66416,Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Gala 1,87,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
66419,Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Sur de los Andes
66421,Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Reserve,88,17,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,El Rosal
66430,Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",,88,23,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Weinert
66433,Argentina,"Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.",Saurus Patagonia,87,9,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Familia Schroeder
66443,Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Reservado,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Amalia
66486,Argentina,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",Grand Reserve,90,20,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Graffigna
66487,Argentina,"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012.",Ultra,90,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
66501,Argentina,"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.",Serie Magno,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
66541,Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors. The body, feel and finish seem right, so for the money it's a blue chip special.",,87,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Funky Llama
66560,Argentina,"This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
66581,Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Flaca,87,16,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Xavier Flouret
66593,Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character. The mouth is centered squarely on purple fruits like plum and wild blackberry, and the feel and finish are comfortable and fresh. Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Alberti 154
66594,Argentina,"Tight on the nose, with hints of resin, lemon peel and black fruit that smell inviting when all added up.

66595,Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Catena Alta,87,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
66656,Argentina,"Scratchy raspberry aromas lend some harshness to the bouquet, but that's replaced soon after by earthy berry fruit notes.

Drink now into 2012.",La Madras Vineyard,89,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ricardo Santos
66690,Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel.

Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Don Valentin Lacrado,87,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
66697,Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting. The mouth is like a black-fruit explosion: muscular berry and tannins fly all over the place, ending in a lively, almost fiery finish. A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Reserve,87,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Filus
66698,Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab.",Reserve,87,17,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,El Rosal
66713,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
66722,Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",D.O.C. Single Vineyard,87,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
66726,Argentina,"Crusty on the nose, with aromas of leather, saucy fruit and alcohol. The wine is full and sweet, with ripe, sturdy flavors of blackberry, plum and raisin followed by fudge and herbs. It blends richness with agility.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zolo
66728,Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tilia
66729,Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry. A little hot but solid on the finish, thus it leaves a tangy final impression.",Medalla,87,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
66739,Argentina,"Chunky and full, with raisin, oak and mocha aromas. The palate comes across round and healthy, with mint and herb notes accenting plum and blackberry flavors.

66742,Argentina,"Norton's Lo Tengo (I Got It) line has a winner in this vivacious Malbec. It's light and a little candied on the nose, but also floral and attractive.

66851,Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes. It's not a big, aggressive wine but it does have tannic strength and intensity. Malbec, Merlot and Cab Sauvignon make up the blend.",Carrascal,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
66862,Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game. The palate is basically a mish-mash of berry flavors and raw tannins, but with food, preferably hamburgers or ribs, it will do the trick.",Santa Isabel,86,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
66864,Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back. It clamps with firm tannins while delivering dark plum and other black-fruit flavors. Gets better with airing and may improve in the bottle. Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",Reserva,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia

Shows real class and character.",Familia,87,58,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Durigutti
66871,Argentina,"Opens with roasted fruit notes and an earthy character that qualifies as intriguing.

66888,Argentina,"In this price class, consistency is a virtue, and year after year Santa Julia's Malbec delivers the basics and a little bit more. This wine has some up-front oak to give warmth, lemon and a mocha or root beer quality to the bouquet. The palate revolves around plum and wild berry flavors, and there's no shortage of oak and mint on the finish.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
66898,Argentina,"For something a little lighter, more herbal and different than the usual Mendoza heavyweight, this multigrape blend offers aromatic notes of pancetta, herb, fennel and dried cherry along with flavors of blueberry and elderflower. It's light-to-medium in size, with a Rhône-style personality. Drink now.",Tinto,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,La Yunta
66932,Argentina,"Chunky, stout and solid on the nose, with round, pure flavors of black cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is comfortable and complete, especially for an $11 wine from Argentina.

66943,Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.",Alzamora,89,30,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Casa Montes
66955,Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas. It's big and tannic on the palate, and thus the sweet, semi-baked flavors of black fruit are appropriate. Sticky and tasting of brown sugar on the finish. Rich but good, especially with grilled beef.",Finca Libertad,88,21,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Benegas
66992,Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
66993,Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Oak Cask,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
66994,Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming.

Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Enzo Bianchi,86,53,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
66999,Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas.

At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Dos Fincas,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
67004,Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Reservado,86,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Amalia
67006,Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors.

67013,Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery.

67027,Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby.

67123,Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there.

Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alamos
67170,Argentina,"A veneer of oak and aromas of root beer greet you, while cherry and raspberry flavors work the palate. It's a lively, tannic wine with a candied, slightly resiny/minty flavor profile and finish. Best with food.",Estate,85,16,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
67171,Argentina,"Plum, blackberry and other fruit aromas work the nose, which is light and airy more than deep and concentrated. The palate is also a touch thin for a reserve-level wine, but the fruit is clean and the finish offers both chocolate and black pepper.",Saurus Patagonia Select,85,14,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
67174,Argentina,"Starts out good, with menthol and wintergreen dominating the nose. The palate is forward and endowed with a lot of red-fruit flavors, but the mouthfeel lets it down. There's too much bounding acidity and not nearly enough lushness.",Violetas Reserve,85,40,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Fincas Don Martino
67176,Argentina,"Mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas are front and center on the nose. The palate is quite sweet and rich, with cola and dark fruit flavors. Generally speaking this wine has the right qualifications to make a positive impression; it is, however, oaky and on the stewy side. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd.",Winemaker's Selection,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andeluna
67183,Argentina,"Don't let the bright purple color and plum/prune aromas fool you: the wine looks deeper and fleshier than it is. In fact, while the palate deals heft and tannin, the depth of fruit is modest and the final package winds up being uncomplicated, but in a good way.",Altosur,85,11,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Finca Sophenia
67187,Argentina,"Light fragrances of talcum powder and apricots lead off this mild-mannered blend, which runs easy and smooth before thinning out on the back palate and finish. But along the way there's good citrus and green-fruit flavors backed by adequate acidity. A good quaff for the price.",Santa Isabel,85,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Nieto Senetiner
67188,Argentina,"Good out of the blocks, with full and creamy berry aromas. The palate doesn't exactly follow that lead as it shows slightly tart red cherry and cranberry flavors. And by the finish there's even a lemony tingle. Best if you like a juicy style.",Limited Edition,85,20,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
67189,Argentina,A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.,Amadores,85,20,Other,Argentina,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Palo Alto
67191,Argentina,"La Vuelta means “the return,” and after a glass or two of this, and with modest expectations, you may want to return to this lighter-styled Malbec. Flavorwise, we're talking strawberry-, cherry- and raspberry-infused tea, while light but noticeable oaking yields finishing notes of mocha.",La Vuelta,85,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodegas Escorihuela
67193,Argentina,"Argentinean Rieslings come along as often as Haley's comet. But this clean, round wine is pretty good in its own right. It features dry almond, white pepper and apple flavors, with additional almond skins on the mineral, lean finish. Not entirely a novelty with 1,550 cases total production.",,85,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Riesling,Luigi Bosca
67197,Argentina,"With varietally correct aromas and nice overall balance, this ranks as a solid, fairly legitimate Argentine Viognier. Hailing from warmer San Juan province, this is a citrus- and honey-based white with size, spice and mouthfeel. For the most part it gets things right.",,85,9,Other,San Juan,,Viognier,Las Moras
67266,Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",,88,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
67270,Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tomero
67283,Argentina,"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.",Grand Reserve,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cruz Alta
67293,Argentina,"Give this young Malbec some time to settle and it rounds into form. The nose goes from funky to finished in a few minutes, while the cherry and cola flavors run with ease toward a lightly tannic finish. Straightforward and likable once it finds its legs.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
67298,Argentina,"Hailing from San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this wine—named after a shade-providing tree—is interesting and different from the masses. The nose is floral and herbal, with pencil eraser and red-fruit aromas, while the mouth is earthy and sort of Old World, with dry, lean tannins and structure.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
67303,Argentina,"Soft and composed bouquet, with fruit aromas you will recognize and nothing funky or strained. The mouth is complete and better than ordinary, with pure but simple cassis, blueberry and plum fruit. A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",Trumpeter,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Rutini
67311,Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",Saurus Patagonia Select,86,20,Other,Neuquén,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder
67316,Argentina,"Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.",,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
67329,Argentina,"Big and bulky, with a mixed bag of aromas that includes field scents, rubber and baked fruit. The palate deals berry and plum flavors, while the finish tilts toward heavy and medicinal. Seems like this one got a bit overripe and sticky. The 2003 was better.",Reserve,85,23,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andeluna
67340,Argentina,"Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",Saurus Patagonia Select,85,14,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Familia Schroeder
67343,Argentina,"For an everyday red that won't wreck the wallet, this juicy, fresh Malbec qualifies. It offers sweet aromas of plum and berry, and the palate follows suit with blueberry and blackberry. The depth and complexity are limited but the fundamentals and enjoyment factor are measurable.",Santa Isabel,85,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
67347,Argentina,"A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",Serie Magno,84,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fantelli
67416,Argentina,"An elegant, better-than-most Torrontés with floral, tropical aromas sitting in front of melon, lemon and lychee flavors. The texture and weight suggest melon, and the finish has just the right level of glycerol and grab. Very nice Torrontés that manages to distinguish itself.",,88,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Inacayal
67439,Argentina,"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft. It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.",Casa,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Marguery
67444,Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Reserva,84,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Luigi Bosca
67448,Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",Reserva,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
67449,Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",,84,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terra Buena
67452,Argentina,"This Patagonian Malbec requires patience and forgiveness. The nose is milky and green at first, but airing paroles riper, redder aromas and flavors. Ultimately there's decent berry character and plumpness but not a lot of follow through or finish.",Mística,84,22,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Estepa
67453,Argentina,"Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine. The mouthfeel, however, runs kind of hard and sheer. May get better in future vintages.",Saurus Patagonia,84,9,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
67454,Argentina,"Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.",Reserve,84,23,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Andeluna
67458,Argentina,"A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",Oak,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Telteca
67467,Argentina,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.",,84,10,Other,La Rioja,,Torrontés,La Yunta
67469,Argentina,"Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",Reserva,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Santa Julia
67471,Argentina,"Minerally peach aromas keep things lean to start, and it's somewhat narrow in outlook throughout. The palate has melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, and there's both citrusy acid and custardy richness to give modest complexity. Like a green-fruit lollipop in liquid form.",,86,13,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Maipe
67473,Argentina,"Jammy and rubbery on the nose, but undeniably bold and friendly as well. The palate is what we'd describe as “happy,” meaning it's full, not too tannic and tasty. Flavors of cassis and ripe plum offer some fatness, and the finish is easygoing. Uncomplicated and good as a value wine.",,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Notro
67474,Argentina,"Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
67573,Argentina,"Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate. Good Merlot for the price.",Malma,87,13,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Bodega NQN
67593,Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Oak,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
67600,Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",White Pearl,84,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
67601,Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Amauta,84,20,Other,Cafayate,,Red Blend,Bodegas El Porvenir De Los Andes
67603,Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Uma,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Telteca
67617,Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Antá Reserve,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
67618,Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit. Ultimately there's not much cushion, so it seems hard.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
67622,Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Black Label,86,18,Other,San Juan,,Bonarda,Las Moras
67623,Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino
67627,Argentina,"Fruity but common on the nose, and acidic and sheering on the palate. No matter how many times you slide this across the palate, it seems tangy and electric. In the midst of all that zest there's bright plum and berry flavors followed by a lively finish. Tasty and cleansing, but choppy.",Serie A,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
67634,Argentina,"Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors are almost in the bubblegum range but are more complex and true than candied. With freshness, nice tannins and decent structure, this wine is giving about all it can.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
67636,Argentina,"Smells distinctly of cherry cola with a dash of lemon peel. The palate is medium-bodied at its richest, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. As a whole it's colorful and easy to like, even if it finishes sort of thin but fresh. Good intentions; low on stuffing.",Trumpeter,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Syrah,Rutini
67644,Argentina,"If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it. It has lower acidity and therefore size and richness. For some it may be syrupy and less than exciting; others will enjoy its ripeness. Drink this year.",Barrica,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Finca El Retiro
67711,Argentina,"A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums. There's even some toasty warmth to the finish. A textbook easy rider.",,87,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zarpado
67718,Argentina,"A good effort for the money. The nose has rubber and bold fruit, while the palate has a natural, balanced feel and nice flavors of berry, cassis, brown sugar and chocolate. Blends juiciness with enough weight and sweetness to rate highly in the value class.",ILKA,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Agostino
67723,Argentina,"Starts out with nice black cherry and cassis aromas before transitioning to roasted plum and prune flavors that come with sticky, fierce tannins and plenty of heat and grab.

67724,Argentina,"Slightly hard and herbal at first blush, but exhibiting more purity and depth of fruit as it opens. Flavors of sweet berries and plum are generic but welcome, and the palate is full and tannic. Overall it's pretty well stacked with fruit and power; it's also tannic and stout.",,87,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Alberto Furque
67735,Argentina,"Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.",Reserve,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
67740,Argentina,"Jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry are just solid enough to win you over, while the flavors of red fruit and cola carry a bit of tang and acidic bite. This is a fresh, lively everyday wine with sweet, standard flavors and a basic, competent mouthfeel.",Finca La Linda,86,11,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
67748,Argentina,"Full on the nose, but there seems to be some brett resulting in aromatic hints of hard cheese and leather. There's energy on the palate, with lemony notes preceding core flavors of cola, cassis and kirsch. Ripe and sweet, but with nothing out of the ordinary. Good Cabernet for the price, but not what you'd call interesting or exciting.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tilia
67754,Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.",,86,19,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marchiori & Barraud
67755,Argentina,"Some barrel influence works its way onto the largely natural bouquet, while the flavors of peach, banana and melon surf a smooth, modestly deep palate. This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
67771,Argentina,"Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors. There's also some citrus and apricot to bulk up the flavor profile. Overall it's a full-bodied but indifferent white. Drink right away for best results.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Viognier,Santa Julia
67773,Argentina,"Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.",Don David Reserve,84,15,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino

67793,Argentina,"If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda. The palate pushes peach, cantaloupe and floral notes, but where's the acidity and where's the grassiness?",Carrascal,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Weinert
67796,Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Finca la Daniela,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Bodega Familia Barberis
67832,Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors. Turns more narrow and simple with time, but for a basic Malbec it more than gets the job done.",Trumpeter,87,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Rutini
67846,Argentina,"Multifaceted on the nose, with aromas of horse saddle and mulch that give way to cleaner floral and berry liqueur scents. The palate is thick, chewy and on the softer side, while the flavors shows rich berry flavors that hint at syrup. Chewy, with a coffee-like essence to the finish.",Reserva,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,François Lurton
67858,Argentina,"Black cherry and a light floral perfume get this generic Cab going in the right direction. The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. Still, it's smooth, fruity and easy to drink.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mil Piedras
67896,Argentina,"Dark, robust and slightly medicinal, with a bouquet that's not run of the mill. The palate is juicy and jacked up on acidity, so we find live-wire cassis, berry and chocolate flavors that aren't quite as integrated as they should be. And it finishes slightly hot and sticky. Expensive for a wine that's all over the map.",Edicion Limitada,86,32,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aguma
67905,Argentina,"It's been many years since we've reviewed a Q Cabernet from Zuccardi, and this one is typically oaky, with plum, raisin, rubber, pepper and roasted fruit on the nose. The palate is tannic and firm, with meaty, grabby berry flavors offset by mocha, vanilla, caramel and other wood-driven flavors. Good wine but it comes with some bite and burn.",Q,86,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zuccardi
67906,Argentina,"Large and ripe on the nose, with rubber, leather and rusticity. The palate is juicy and quick, with medium-weight tannins that frame lively cherry and blackberry flavors.

67907,Argentina,"Septima's first crack at making a big wine leaves us intrigued but not thrilled. This is dark, meaty, saturated and most of all heavily oaked. It smells like coconut and veneer, while the rich, bulky palate is packed with resin, vanilla, cinnamon and blackberry. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat, and it could stand to be more refined and balanced than it is.",Gran Reserva,86,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Septima
67908,Argentina,"After starting out somewhat murky and muddled, it gets to better footing. The palate is thick and meaty, with sweet, semibaked fruit flavors and a handful of carob nibs.

67914,Argentina,"A very rich, sun-drenched style of Malbec that smells like a chocolate-and-fruit candy bar and tastes like ripe blackberry, raisin and pie filling.

67930,Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine.

67934,Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness.

Not a lot of complexity or angles to ponder, but the wine's fruit content and mouthfeel are both more than good for the price.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lamadrid
68043,Argentina,"Mint and heat on the nose give way to baked dark-fruit aromas and earth. The palate is warm, structured and solid, with solid raspberry and plum flavors. Slightly creamy and candied on the finish, with coconut from the barrel and a final blast of heat. Not a wine for aging; drink now with food.",Grand Reserve,86,20,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Graffigna
68047,Argentina,"A fuller-bodied wine with round, cidery aromas and a whack of wood resin. The palate is spherical and honeyed, with apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors. For Argentinean Chardonnay it's well made and respectable, but at $20 it's not going to turn many heads.",Catena,86,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
68051,Argentina,"Ample red plum and cassis both on the nose and palate makes this a proper Malbec wine. However, it's juicy and a bit acidic on the tongue, which makes the plum core a little shrill. Overall it's lively, mildly herbal, honest and gets the job done. Definitely falls into the fresh and snappy category.",Oak Cask,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
68052,Argentina,"Dense, robust and a little jagged, with violet, graphite and blackberry aromas that stir interest. The palate is ultraripe, a touch saucy and thick, and full of black fruit and chocolate flavors. Short on the finish but a good carry over from the nose and palate. It sits on the cusp of being overdone but manages to hang in there.",Old Vine,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terra Rosa
68056,Argentina,"Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.",Reserva,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
68061,Argentina,"Licorice, dark spice and berry pie right down to the buttery crust make for a decent nose. In the mouth, it's creamy and warm, with full-bodied plum and raisin flavors alongside a shot of acidity and chocolate on the finish. Not very complex but it delivers the basics.",,85,13,Other,La Rioja,,Malbec,Chañarmuyo
68070,Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Linea Tonel,82,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Finca La Anita
68071,Argentina,"Rubbery and overly woody, and the palate really burns along with high acidity and short, staccato fruit flavors. Zesty and challenging throughout; it just doesn't push the right buttons given its reserve status and price.",Reserva,82,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
68078,Argentina,"This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",,82,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Tango Sur
68083,Argentina,"With little to compare it to, it's hard to evaluate the correctness of this Semillon sweetie from Argentina. Let's just say that it's a weird wine that carries a vivid yellow color and aromas and flavors of honey, corn syrup and hominy.",Famiglia Bianchi Late Harvest,82,23,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Valentin Bianchi
68091,Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are also noticeably green and medicinal, while the palate offers raspberry flavors with a giant supplement of leafy, weedy flavors. On one hand the wine has some class and style; on the other hand questionable purity and ripeness stand out.  Imported by North American Beverage Group.",,81,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Domaine Jean Bousquet

68094,Argentina,"Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.",Saurus Patagonia,81,9,Other,Neuquén,,Chardonnay,Familia Schroeder
68097,Argentina,"Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",Gran Reserva,81,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
68135,Argentina,"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose.

68149,Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",,86,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cruz Alta
68153,Argentina,"Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors. More herbal on the finish, with coconut entering the picture.",Reserva,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Espiritu de Argentina
68192,Argentina,"A big step up from previous failures, this vintage shows tropical fruit aromas and some sea breeze. The flavors are of pineapple and tangerine, and the acidity is nice. On the finish, the fruit holds and the feel is right. Drink soon to capture the wine's perky freshness.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Carlos Basso
68193,Argentina,"Lots of red-fruit aromas send it out in familiar fashion, while the palate runs a bit zesty and acidic. This is not as soft and rich as in the past; the flavors rest on bright plum and cherry fruit with plenty of acidic kick. Solid but regular as Malbec goes, and probably in need of food to give the acids something to work on.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alamos
68198,Argentina,"Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Tilia
68206,Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",Alta,85,9,Other,Tulum Valley,,Malbec,Callia
68207,Argentina,"With solid peach aromas and an otherwise clean nose, this llama is worth the ride. Peach and honeydew flavors are sweet but not cloying or mucky, and there's even a hint of spicy white pepper to give the finish character.",,85,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
68208,Argentina,"Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made.",Gemela Reserva,85,20,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Santa Justina
68216,Argentina,"Sweet, candied and ever so slightly green on the nose, with generic but fairly solid cassis and berry flavors coming next. The feel leans toward gritty, while the finish is of moderate length and depth. Like a million other Cabs, but still o.k. for everyday drinking.",Barrel Select,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
68219,Argentina,"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",Estela Armando Vineyard,85,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,La Posta
68220,Argentina,"The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",Reserva,81,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Tittarelli
68223,Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish. It's not a foul or dirty wine; but it isn't what we've come to expect from SB.",Saurus Patagonia Select,81,14,Other,Neuquén,,Sauvignon Blanc,Familia Schroeder
68224,Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Finca la Daniela,81,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
68225,Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Valle Huarpe,81,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Bodega José Quattrocchi
68228,Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Gran Reserva,81,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Telteca
68229,Argentina,"Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.",Antigua Cava,80,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Familia Barberis
68230,Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",San Carlos,80,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
68231,Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",,80,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Santa Julia
68234,Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Tunuyan,80,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Carlos Basso
68235,Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent. It's like a wet-vintage cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Viña Cornejo Costas High Altitude Vineyards,80,10,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Don Rodolfo
68236,Argentina,"Rowdy and aggressive stuff; where's the charm and poise, even in a value-priced wine? The nose is rambling and penetrating, while the palate is tart like sucking candy. A raw wine that should be better.",,80,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
68312,Argentina,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.",Old Vine,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Llama
68315,Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8.",,86,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,La Vuelta
68316,Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry.

68318,Argentina,"This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors. Nothing is out of the ordinary; the palate is bright and focused on simple berry flavors, while the finish has proper feel, lift and power. Shows a good mixture of fruit, acid and tannin.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vila
68332,Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
68333,Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Estate Bottled,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dante Robino
68343,Argentina,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.",Oak Cask,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trapiche
68344,Argentina,"A long with aromas of dried cheese, earth and rubber, there's enough clean black fruit to bring it home. The palate is snappy and fresh, with edgy, lively plum and berry flavors. The finish is short but offers some flashes of quality. Basic but solid Cab.",,85,9,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tupun
68357,Argentina,"A big, sweet wine that doesn't have much teeth or bite but is friendly, rich and pleasing.

Finishes with a kiss of chocolate bon bon but little structure or grip. Drink now.",Dos Fincas,85,10,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Carlos Basso
68367,Argentina,"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.",Cocina Blend,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,La Posta
68433,Argentina,"Jammy stuff, with hints of mint, leather and cotton candy. The palate is basic, with adequate structure and nicely presented berry fruit as well as herbal accents. Sweet on the finish, with some sugary stickiness. Gets better with time in the glass.",Serie Terra Roble,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viniterra
68441,Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cruz Alta
68492,Argentina,"Clean white wine, with white-fruit aromas and some prickle. The palate is linear and simple, with nectarine, citrus pith and tangerine-orange on the finish. A good, basic wine with one-dimensionality. Perfect for party time quaffing.",Reserva,85,14,Other,La Rioja,,Torrontés,Tamarí
68495,Argentina,"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.",Oak Cask,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
68498,Argentina,"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex, we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively, fresh and perfectly drinkable.",Serie A,85,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Zuccardi
68500,Argentina,"Lively nectarine and citrus aromas give it early life, and the palate is equally zesty, with tangerine and pineapple flavors. This is good Sauvignon Blanc for Argentina, with plenty of citrus but not a lot of nuance or complexity.",,85,9,Other,San Juan,,Sauvignon Blanc,Las Moras
68505,Argentina,"Plump and sweet smelling, with bacon, wood smoke, sawdust and cotton candy aromas. The feel is jammy and the flavors of bacon-infused roasted fruit suggest some forced wood treatment. But overall the wine is satisfying, with pretty good mouthfeel. Approach it noncritically and it should do the trick.",,85,14,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Merlot,Pascual Toso
68508,Argentina,"Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dante Robino
68510,Argentina,"A light, mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic, the wine tastes of strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.",Selección,85,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Alamos
68514,Argentina,"Ripe, pure and dense for a bargain-priced Malbec. The palate is a bit chunky and stolid, but the flavors of ripe berry, chocolate and beef stock ring true and the feel is clean and cushioned. A good but regular wine where the basics are covered.",Finca Monte Lindo,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
68519,Argentina,"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear. The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together. A novelty wine that shows the right signs.",Reserva Chardonnay-Pinot Gris,85,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,White Blend,Domaine Jean Bousquet
68594,Argentina,"Not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose. It remains somewhat jammy in the mouth, with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors. Good but candied and basic.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cruz Alta
68597,Argentina,"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Four Aces
68598,Argentina,"Dense, soupy and a little raisiny, with an overripe quality to the nose. Jammy in the mouth, but on the palate things unwind and improve.

Only go here if you like full, rich, sweet red wines.",Barrel Select,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
68640,Argentina,"Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled, but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors.

68647,Argentina,"Nice on the nose, with masculine, dense aromas of ripe berry fruits. The palate begins snappy and gets more sheering as the wine unfolds; in the meantime, the cherry, berry and plum flavors are more compact than candied. Well-done for Bonarda, but slightly narrow and grabbing the more you get to know it.",Reserva,85,11,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Bonarda,Tupun
68652,Argentina,"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet. Generic flavors of baked plum and berry are lifted by slicing acids, while the finish bounces along before ending with some straightforward chocolate and berry notes.",La Pilar,85,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Xavier Flouret
68656,Argentina,"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.",Reserve,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Aconcagua
68657,Argentina,"Basic Torrontés aromas of citrus, greens and saline water greet you. The wine is light-framed and rings and zings on the palate. Lemon and green apple share the palate before lime rises up on the finish. A bit clanky but gets the job done when chilled down.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Avenue
68659,Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors.

68666,Argentina,"Yet another solid but unspectacular Malbec from Las Moras. The nose is rubbery and meaty, with leather and barnyardy brett notes. The palate is chunky and fleshy, with blackberry, stem and tobacco flavors. Good structure; mediocre aromas and flavor components.",Reserve,84,12,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
68669,Argentina,"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy, basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.",Organica,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
68741,Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry.

Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Reservado,86,16,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
68796,Argentina,"A big, roasted and fiery nose is act one, while act two offers a raisiny palate with black cherry and cassis flavors.

A hot-climate wine with integrity but marginal balance.",,84,13,Other,La Rioja,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chañarmuyo
68798,Argentina,"Starts with thick, raisiny aromas and later perfume and violets enter the scene.

Seems top-loaded, without much structure or finish to seal the deal.",,84,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Conquista de Argentina
68805,Argentina,"There's no escaping the wine's funky, leathery aromas that settle on moss and earth. Familiar plum and berry flavors have a touch of stem in the mix, while the finish is full, medicinal and anchored by mildly bitter tannins. Not bad but tastes and feels a little roasted and rough.",,84,17,Other,Zonda Valley,,Syrah,Xumek
68819,Argentina,"Opens with light but earthy raspberry aromas and plum, and then it breaks up a bit with airing. The palate is lean but fresh and gritty, with cherry and cola flavors in front of a limited, narrow finish. Run-of-the-mill, which isn't bad given the price.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Don Bosco
68880,Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Tonada,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca La Anita
68883,Argentina,"Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors. Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.",Barrel Select,85,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
68891,Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Mil Piedras
68896,Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries. Finishes sort of bland and slightly herbal. Good but entirely basic in its approach.",,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cristobal 1492
68905,Argentina,"A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.",,85,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,La Vuelta
68942,Argentina,"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors.

68947,Argentina,"The Cabernets here, if you hadn't already guessed, are Sauvignon and Franc. There's a distinct herbal element to the nose, creating a “green” aromatic sensation.

Spicy but hot on the finish.",Black Label Cabernet - Cabernet,84,18,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Las Moras
68953,Argentina,"Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle.",Pr1mum,84,64,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Pinot Noir,Salentein
68955,Argentina,"Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”",Tinto Fundación,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vila
68958,Argentina,"Orange peel, green fruits and then not much else make for a standard nose. The palate is full-sized and melony, and so is the plump, sweet finish.

68959,Argentina,"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy.

While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alberti 154
69037,Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",,85,15,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Alpataco
69044,Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
69052,Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
69105,Argentina,"Strawberry, cherry and other red-fruits comprise a thin-styled bouquet, and pretty much the rest of the show follows suit. The palate is of medium weight, without much heft or structure. Flavors of red fruits are lean.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Bodega Norton
69106,Argentina,"Smells like apple blossom and saline solution, and the wet, fresh palate tastes of pineapple and mango. It's a modest Chard in every way, with medium concentration and nectarine and pickle on the finish.",,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
69116,Argentina,"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tupun
69119,Argentina,"In an attempt to ramp things up, Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit, tire rubber and a distinct green streak.

Not one of Rutini's better efforts.",,83,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutini
69165,Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine.

69180,Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface.

69187,Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry.

Walks to the beat of its own drummer; uncommon for Malbec.",,83,9,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
69244,Argentina,"This Reserve holdover from '05 is '0 well-oaked, so there are clear-cut coffee and mocha aromas to go with adequate fruit scents.

69248,Argentina,"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon.

69267,Argentina,"Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness, but the palate does not deliver.

It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity.

71401,Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Altosur,88,11,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
71402,Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Luigi Bosca Reserva,88,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
71429,Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Edicion Limitada,88,45,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71445,Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Reserve Organic,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Caligiore
71448,Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",,88,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aleph
71471,Argentina,"Good wine, especially if you like some new oak that brings a lot of cream, vanilla and chocolate to the game. Along the way there's plenty of boysenberry, blueberry and other sweet dark-fruit flavors. A winner that should meet the expectations of many.",Reserve,88,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Novus
71473,Argentina,"Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes. The oak may be a bit buttery and the tannins fairly full, but overall this does a good job of impersonating a much pricier wine; it's big, liberally oaked, ripe and quite good as a whole.",Reserva,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
71476,Argentina,"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.",Q,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
71485,Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.",Prodigo Reserva,87,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alessandro Speri
71488,Argentina,"Still not sure what the difference is between Sur de los Andes and Alma de los Andes (they're from the same winery), but this wine seems a tiny bit more open and friendly than the Alma. It's evolved, sweet and full of blackberry and blueberry flavors. And the finish carries some warm baked notes that anchor the deal.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
71491,Argentina,"Santa Julia doesn't try to trick you with its wines. They are what they are, and for under  10 this creamy, berry-packed wine should please the masses. The fruit is plump and ripe, while the mouthfeel is round and healthy. A great model for quality, affordable Malbec.",,87,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
71526,Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",,87,9,Other,San Juan,,Sauvignon Blanc,Las Moras
71535,Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Chakana
71541,Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
71544,Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard. This version offers peach and other stone-fruit aromas, while the palate presents smooth white fruit and toast flavors. Fairly long, with a healthy feel throughout.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
71557,Argentina,"As always, this late-harvest white delivers peach and lychee aromas, and it's even better in the mouth, where intense lychee and pineapple flavors rise up and steal the show.",Tardío,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Santa Julia
71566,Argentina,"Like most of Alma's wines, this Bonarda is smooth, fruity and approachable. The nose is simple and offers some spice, licorice and herb notes, while the berry flavors are just as they should be: easy and jammy. There's nothing challenging about this red; just pour it with pizza or burgers and enjoy.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alma de los Andes
71568,Argentina,"Punchbowl melon and tropical fruit aromas are the lead act. Next up is a zesty palate of green apple, melon and citrus. The body is a bit plump and round, while the finish shows orange peel and lime zest. Good for Mendoza Sauv Blanc.",Antá,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Telteca
71571,Argentina,"Warm earth and other dark, leathery aromas dominate. In the mouth, there's black cherry and raspberry flavors supported by scratchy tannins. Despite some grab and clumsiness, this is a good Cabernet with ripeness and a forward personality.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
71597,Argentina,"Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",Opalo,86,18,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Syrah,Mauricio Lorca
71604,Argentina,"We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy. The mouthfeel runs tight and the tannins are spunky and on the border of being rough. Maybe another year will settle it down.",Particular,86,30,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
71615,Argentina,"Simple red-fruit aromas, sweetness and balance come right away on the bouquet, and the palate is basically the same thing: pleasant strawberry and raspberry flavors and a good feel. Nothing fancy but smooth and fun to drink. Commendable given that production is 50,000 cases.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
71627,Argentina,"Leather, mint and a touch of raisin make for a fairly ripe and mature bouquet. The palate follows with reasonably vibrant berry flavors and a little chocolaty heft. If it falls a bit flat on the tail that only means that it's not for aging and is meant to drink now.",,86,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
71637,Argentina,"Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit. Not as forward and clean as it should be; but has its benefits. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Ique,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71639,Argentina,"Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.",Prodigo,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alessandro Speri
71649,Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",Laborum Limited Edition,85,49,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Bodegas El Por Venir de los Andes
71655,Argentina,"Young and sturdy, with pear and apple aromas enveloped in popcorn and wood. The palate offers standard New World weight and sweetness along with flavors of pear, vanilla and oak. More on the full-bodied, oaky side, but generally it's balanced and approachable.",Reserva,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Nieto Senetiner
71656,Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Terruño Lunlunta,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71663,Argentina,"Simple but nice in its class. The nose offers bulky but clean fruit and a touch of saddle, while the palate is ample, fruity and round. It flairs out on the finish but keeps rolling in the right direction. Good for the price.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
71666,Argentina,"Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.",Reserva,85,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terrazas de Los Andes
71680,Argentina,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",Reserva,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nieto Senetiner
71699,Argentina,"Honeysuckle and other sweet aromas greet you. In back of that there are flavors of pineapple, mango and apple. This runs crisp and tangy with more lemon-drop character than butter or vanilla.",Finca la Daniela,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Familia Barberis
71705,Argentina,"Soft, lightly fragrant and peachy, with a hint of talcum powder to the nose. The palate offers your basic mix of melon and lychee, while the feel is good and there's a persistent finish. Straightforward stuff.",Uma,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Telteca
71713,Argentina,The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.,Estate Bottled,84,11,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Sauvignon Blanc,Finca El Portillo
71719,Argentina,"Sweet pear and powdered sugar carry the confected nose, while the palate is also on the sweet side, with sugared citrus and banana flavors. Feelwise, there's adequate acidity to keep it wet and juicy, while the finish is candied but not what you'd call sticky. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.",Famiglia Bianchi,84,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Chardonnay,Valentin Bianchi
71734,Argentina,"For an affordable Argentine Chardonnay, this is not a bad effort. But it is a little oily and loaded down with movie popcorn and buttery aromas. Medium in depth, with candied flavors and a peppery bitterness to the finish.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terrazas de Los Andes
71740,Argentina,"A little charred and bulky, but pretty good for a basic New World Cabernet. The nose is a mix of ripe fruit, licorice and herbs, while the palate is tame and veers to strawberry. Simple and a touch herbal.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
71744,Argentina,"Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity. The mouthfeel is a bit raw and tangy, but overall it is clean and presents itself well.",Reserve,84,13,Mendoza Province,Alto Valle de Uco,,Syrah,Novus
71750,Argentina,"Fading fast; this plump, hot-climate Chard is pretty much as expected: there's lots of oak covering peach, butterscotch and apple cider aromas and flavors. Borderline cloying.",Estate,83,16,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Chardonnay,Doña Paula
71753,Argentina,"Fairly sweet on the nose, with plum and a touch of spice. Things get more rugged in the mouth, where cherry and blackberry flavors carry a medicinal edge. A big Syrah but also a clumsy, heavy-handed one. Proceed with caution.",Reserva,83,15,Other,Famatina Valley,,Syrah,La Puerta
71754,Argentina,"Some dry oak and smoke frames simple earth and berry aromas, but the mouth is condensed and flat. There isn't much bounce to this overripe red; it's heavy and seems to have caught a lot of sun in the vineyard.",,83,9,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
71755,Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",Reserve,83,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
71756,Argentina,"Intense on the nose and colorful, but in the end this wine shows little character, complexity or style. It's all about color and extract but you don't get much richness, charm or ripeness. And it's almost sassy and tangy on the palate and finish.",Finca Los Lirios de los Andes,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Faustina
71757,Argentina,"Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map. This overoaked, charred Cabernet is a perfect example of a wine without a cause. It's burnt, herbal and while it has mouthfeel, nothing seems to be working in tandem.",Famiglia Bianchi,83,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
71761,Argentina,"Light and spicy, with snappy, lean flavors of cherry and cranberry. This is more tart and underwhelming than most Malbec fans probably want, but it's not bad if you crave a lip-smacking red with zest.",Cava Negra,83,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
71763,Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a touch of hard cheese backing that up. The mouth is jumpy and rustic, with raspberry and cherry skin flavors. Finishes lean, scouring and a bit hard.",,83,9,Other,San Juan,,Bonarda,Las Moras
71766,Argentina,"Sort of soupy and stewy to begin with. The palate is stocky and forward, with short black plum and berry flavors. Quite ripe on the back end as it finishes chewy and soft. Organic.",,83,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alto Salvador
71770,Argentina,"All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price. It is a touch musky and heavy on the nose, but the palate holds form as it delivers round banana and melon flavors along with some vanilla and sponge cake on the finish.",,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
71771,Argentina,"A bit heavy and bitter, but otherwise this is pretty decent. Not much can be said about the mild nose: it's typical but not that expressive.

71778,Argentina,"Rather raisiny and herbal, with deep plum and blackberry flavors. It's a weighty wine with a finish that runs straight to prune and chocolate. A bit heavy and dull even at this everyday price point.",Solo Tango,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tawert S.A.
71780,Argentina,"Quite syrupy and stewy, with chunky fruit flavors and a lot of wayward heft. On the plus side there's coffee and bitter chocolate, but overall there's just not much elegance or lightness.",,83,9,Other,Famatina Valley,,Malbec,La Puerta
71787,Argentina,". The citrus and grapefruit aromas come across a little mealy and the wine never really rises above its candied citrus and apple cider qualities.

71792,Argentina,Spearmint and dry red fruit carry the nose. The palate shows basic sweet cherry and strawberry flavors but not much Cabernet character. All in all it's a stripped-back wine that offers rudimentary red-fruit character.,,82,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alto Salvador
71794,Argentina,"Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish. The palate is a saturated fusing of berry syrup, chocolate and alcohol. Almost Port-like in weight and style, but also very aggressive.",Libertad Vineyard,82,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Benegas
71802,Argentina,"A stewy Cabernet; the nose mixes cola with Fernet Branca and never does the wine approach anything we might label charming.

71806,Argentina,"The bouquet hits with reduced aromas of children's vitamin and pineapple, while the palate goes straight to hard cider and orange peel. It's a firm, acidic style that finishes citric and a touch bitter. Doesn't really smell or taste much like Chardonnay.",Clara Benegas,82,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Benegas

Too unusual and challenging.,Reserve Organic,81,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Caligiore

71867,Argentina,"On the bouquet it leans toward ripe and heady but there's also a strong herbal and tomato element that creates a green element.

81346,Argentina,"Initially you get nothing but herbs, spice and tomato off this Bordeaux blend. The nose deals bell pepper, red pepper flake and tomato such that it smells more like chimichurri than wine. But with airing it improves to reveal dry strawberry, cherry and herbal spice flavors.

81597,Argentina,"Chocolaty raspberry and plum aromas are oaky and hint at vanilla. The palate is fairly soft, with freshening acidity hoisting up sweet plum and blackberry jam flavors.

Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.",Dos Fincas,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
81945,Argentina,"Lightly herbal and red in character, with tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is snappy and emphasizes freshness, while the flavors are herbal and leafy, with plenty of red berry and cherry. Snappy and pointed, with a leafy overriding personality.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Espuela del Gaucho
81946,Argentina,"Good wine but a touch stemmy and burnt smelling. After the brushy, herbal aromas comes a juicy, crisp red fruit palate with raspberry and plum flavors but also a bit of green at the core. Finishes bold but a little hot and scratchy.",Old Vine,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Diseño
82031,Argentina,"This smells of rubber, plastic, creamy milk chocolate and berry. The wine has good body, but the oak element has a greasy, buttery taste. Core flavors of herbal plum and berry end with a leathery finish.",La Pilar Reserva,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Xavier Flouret
82046,Argentina,"Talcum powder and apple aromas accompany a big whiff of resinous oak. On the palate, it's tropical in both feel and flavors, with plenty of weight and aggressive tastes of pineapple and mango. Feels a bit sticky and not quite precise, with a chunky finish.",Reserva,85,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Finca Agostino
82143,Argentina,"Full and dark from the beginning, with black plum, floral notes and a clean overall presentation.

Stylish on the finish; nice Malbec.",Serie A,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
82157,Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous at first, but with time weighty, meaty black fruit aromas come out. The wine carries a rich, syrupy mouthfeel and dense, dark flavors of blackberry and pepper.

82160,Argentina,"Spicy and bricky on the nose, with tobacco, earth and herbal red berry aromas. The palate is round and tight, with roasted cassis and berry flavors along with a dusty aftertaste. Sweet on the finish, like brown sugar and roasted berries.",Ultra,87,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaiken
82176,Argentina,"A black-fruit aroma comes with accents of tobacco and prune but also a strong, almost vegetal green angle.

82192,Argentina,"This is dusty and smooth up front, with plenty of oak, balsamic, plum and berry aromas.

82231,Argentina,"Clean, timid and melony on the nose, with an emphasis on clean. Fresh and light in the mouth, and tasty despite being 100% uncomplicated. Flavors of sweet apple, pear and citrus are pleasant and should carry mass appeal. Good for an everyday white quaffer.",,85,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Funky Llama
82248,Argentina,"Neutral smelling other than a hint of peach and vanilla on the bouquet. Comes across a bit heavy and warm, but not too much so.

82252,Argentina,"Earthy and leathery smelling, but very much on the light-bodied side for Malbec. The palate is angular and slightly acidic, with juicy, spicy red-cherry flavors. Racy and lean on the finish, with a final wash of cleansing acids.",Tarquino,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Argento
82255,Argentina,"Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well.

82277,Argentina,"Among Catena's high-end wines from 2007, Nicasia is the top performer. It shows alluring aromas of smoky oak, wild flowers and pure berry fruits.

82285,Argentina,"Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,120,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
82290,Argentina,"This smells candied and oddly citrusy, with unusual blueberry and exotic spice aromas. The mouthfeel is fresh and grabby, while the flavors of raspberry and vanilla are generally appealing and alert. Short on the finish.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Mountain Door
82298,Argentina,"A foxy berry aroma and a jammy character define the nose on this jumpy, juicy Bonarda. Although it tastes fresh, it doesn't offer a whole lot of structure or seriousness. It tastes candied and full of berry and buttery oak flavors. There's a vanilla note on the finish.",Sustainably Farmed,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Zolo
82309,Argentina,"This is an easy type of wine made from Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It opens with simple, familiar aromas of jammy berry and milk chocolate, followed by a creamy-textured palate, with thickness and oaky flavors of hickory, raspberry jam and vanilla. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much complexity or nuance.",Esencia,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Casarena
82344,Argentina,"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast.",Reserve,90,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
82440,Argentina,"Rustic on first blush, with smoky, lightly baked berry fruit aromas. It's rubbery and grabby in the mouth, with sweet caramel and brown sugar accents to the core baked berry fruit flavors. Toasty and peppery on the finish, then sweet as it fades out. A little hot at 14.8% alcohol.",,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tomero
82443,Argentina,"A touch rubbery and medicinal if you get deep into the bouquet, with sizable berry aromas to boot.

Toasty and chocolaty on the finish.",Reserve,87,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Menduco
82446,Argentina,"Yellow in color, with baked corn, heavy oak and implied sweetness on the bouquet. The palate is almost syrupy in feel, with sugary flavors of baked pear, apple and butterscotch. Finishes weighty and heavy; almost like a late-harvest wine. Drink immediately.",Lindaflor,87,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Monteviejo
82451,Argentina,"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting.

Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.",Estate,87,16,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Doña Paula
82453,Argentina,"A bit shocking and overpowering initially, with pull-back early aromas and alcohol-related burn. Give it time and it displays itself as a full, ripe, complex wine with heavy extraction and ripe peach, apricot and bitter flavors. Toffee and caramel lead the spicy, still-bitter finish.",Historias Passito de los Andes,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Muscat,Familia Marguery
82473,Argentina,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",Reserve,88,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zolo
82534,Argentina,"Tropical and blowsy on the nose. The palate is now chunky and heavy, while the flavors are mustardy and oily, with fruit notes that fall into the melon, peach and orange field. Flat and short on the finish, which indicates that it's already fading. Better to wait for the 2010.",Urban Uco,84,11,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,O. Fournier
82536,Argentina,"Light and herbal on the nose, with a dilute set of raspberry and strawberry aromas. The palate has some creaminess but overall it tastes generic and baked, with syrupy sweetness at its core. An average wine with jammy qualities and focus issues.",Reserva,84,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Uva Negra
82542,Argentina,"More leafy and mulchy than ideal, with coffee, herbal notes and a light green quality to the nose. The feel is starchy, and the flavors run burnt, mildly green and sweet, with a pasty, sticky finish. Has some merit but also falls a little short.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Árido
82545,Argentina,"Light and airy, with orange blossom and powdered sugar aromas. The palate is round and offers enough crisp acidity to keep the wine's lychee and lemon-lime flavors moving in the right direction. Reasonably good for ten bucks.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
82551,Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with a simple, candied, somewhat strained nose. The palate feels sharp while the acidity-tannin combo creates a narrowing mouthfeel. Flavors are roasted, herbal and lemony, while the finish is jumpy and edgy.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Uva Negra
82557,Argentina,"A little stinky and oily, which is often the downfall of the variety. The palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary, i.e. simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn. Seems only semifresh at a young age.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Torrontés,Bodega Goulart
82558,Argentina,"Smells foxy and broken up, with a slight stemminess. The palate is tannic and drawing, with generic black fruit flavors that are candied with brown sugar and molasses. Sweet, rough, tough and like 1,000 others. Will do best with food, which should absorb some of the tannic shock.",Reserve,84,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia

82657,Argentina,"This is a perfectly solid, fresh Torrontés, with lime, pineapple and banana aromas and similar flavors. Add in some acid-based agility and lift, and this ranks as an everyday quaffer of the first order. Drink immediately.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Fat Gaucho
82660,Argentina,"Butter and coconut aromas announce the liberal use of oak, which the palate echoes with its round, resiny feel and flavors of vanilla, wood and baked pear. This is soft, flat and sugary tasting, with an oaky finish.",,85,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Casarena
82675,Argentina,"This smells bland but clean, with a hint of citrus. It feels spritzy but simple, with papaya, green melon and mild citrus flavors. Good in a very basic way, but drink now before it fades.",Malma Finca la Papay,84,11,Other,Patagonia,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodega NQN
82679,Argentina,"Tropical in scent, almost to the point of air freshener, this also has an oily, bitter hint to the bouquet. It feels choppy and citric, with a nuttiness to the core of tangerine, lemon and melon flavors. Good but fading.",Verano,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Solsticio
82742,Argentina,"Ripe, rubbery berry aromas become like chocolate-covered cherry with time.

82760,Argentina,"Dense, meaty and lightly herbal on the nose, with minty berry notes. The palate is firm and issues tannic crack in front of plum, herbal flavors, brown sugar and vanilla. Turns mildly hot and grating on the finish, with juicy length. Good for everyday Malbec.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
82763,Argentina,"Full berry aromas with spice on the side form a good opening. It's a full, tight wine on the palate with oaky, meaty, almost foresty flavors of blackberry, spice and mint. Racy, drying, tasty and good given that one finds few Syrah-Bonarda blends to pick from.",SyBo,87,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah-Bonarda,Montepio
82838,Argentina,"A bit gaseous on the nose, with cidery apple aromas. The palate is waxy, oily and heavy, with chunky melon and papaya flavors.

82844,Argentina,"Mildly tropical on the nose, but for the most part the bouquet lacks punch. The palate has friction and an oily feel, while the flavors are generic as they suggest apple and lime. Chalky and kind of bland on the finish; seems to be fading.",Broquel,84,15,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Trapiche
82845,Argentina,"Earthy aromas mix with high-toned red fruit scents, while the palate is narrow and linear, with mildly green, saucy flavors that crowd out mild red fruit notes that fight to enter the picture. Herbal on the finish, but not offensive or difficult to drink.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
82847,Argentina,"A blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin that's more novel than impressive.

Creamy on the finish as well, and low in acidity.",Tiara,84,30,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,White Blend,Viña Alicia
82850,Argentina,"Other than showing orange and tangerine, the nose is a bit too much like air freshener. In the mouth, it's wet but on the hollow side, with dilute innocuous flavors. Decent but low on flavor; seemingly fading.",Premium,84,13,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Piattelli
82875,Argentina,"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness.

82948,Argentina,"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice.

83001,Argentina,"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear.

83018,Argentina,"Minerally and dry smelling, with floral aromas along with the scents of white peach and apple. The palate feels good and clean, with roundness matched by nice acidity.

83171,Argentina,"Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine.

83437,Argentina,"Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick.

83441,Argentina,"Raw on the nose, with a hard, tannic palate that features sweet black-fruit flavors, a chemical burn and raisin.

Finishes roasted, with licorice and rock-hard tannins.",Luna Benegas,83,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benegas
83443,Argentina,"Neutral smelling with a hint of lemon-lime and children's vitamin. The palate is wet but doesn't bring much more in the way of feel, while the flavors are flat, melony and hint at apple. This wine is old by PG standards but not yet dead.

83455,Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish.

83458,Argentina,"An odd bird on the nose, where floral, lavender aromas replace the normal set of cassis and berry. In the mouth, it's so tannic that it's like chewing nails; the flavors, therefore, seem choppy and hard, like roasted blackberry and sugar beets. Very woody and mentholated, too.",Reservado,83,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carlos Basso

83575,Argentina,"This Cabernet-Malbec blend starts out with herbal, piquant aromas, with a twinge of volatility and a funky masa scent. It's pretty good on the palate, which is by far the wine's best point, but the flavors are earthy, nutty and herbal, rather than bright and focused. Tasted twice, this note reflects the better bottle.",Nina,83,30,Other,Aminga Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,San Huberto

85302,Argentina,"Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather.

Long on the finish, with the sum exceeding each part.",,90,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tempus Alba
85504,Argentina,"Opens with heavy, gaseous aromas but once it settles down it shows much better. The palate is warm and chunky, with full berry flavors that come with a bit of earthy funk.

A fringe Cabernet for fans of Argentina.",Cuma Organic,84,13,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino
85633,Argentina,"Baked smelling, with a touch of black cherry. The palate is saucy and artificial tasting, with waves of milk chocolate, marshmallow and other sweet flavors.

It holds form on the finish.",Oak Cask,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trapiche
86081,Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively.

Other than the acidic sharpness, this is a solid everyday Cab.",,84,11,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alma Mora
91457,Argentina,"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors.",Reserve,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
91462,Argentina,"Not a bad little SB for bargain shoppers. It's soft and simple, with white fruit aromas and a touch of orange blossom on the nose. The palate is easy in feel, with mild citrus flavors. Innocuous as they come.",,84,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Funky Llama
91622,Argentina,"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now–2015.",Gran Medalla,92,46,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
91628,Argentina,"This is cool, earthy and tight on the nose. Then it opens and blooms, with classy roasted notes that set the stage for a smooth-rolling palate with bold blackberry, herb and chocolate flavors. By the time it finishes, complex bitter-chocolate and toast notes have taken over. This is primed and ready to drink.",Limited Edition,92,47,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
91691,Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Reservado,86,16,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
91746,Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",Don Nicanor,84,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Nieto Senetiner
91751,Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.",Saurus Select,84,17,Other,Patagonia,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder
91756,Argentina,"A touch tough and stemmy on the nose, but given the price it rates as positive. The body is medium and friendly, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry feature a peppery accent. Finishes crisp and fresh.",,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zarpado
91759,Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas. In the mouth, it's scratchy and spicy, with herbal berry fruit leading to a mildly bitter finish. Better than in the past, but still a compromised wine due to its minty, green characteristics.",Felino,84,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Viña Cobos
91760,Argentina,"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors.

91946,Argentina,"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry. This is youthful and more fruit focused than the oakier DJN 2006 Reserva Malbec.",Don Juan Nahuel,92,32,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cielo y Tierra
91950,Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Tonada,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca La Anita
91953,Argentina,"Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors.

91961,Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple.

91966,Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries.

91975,Argentina,"A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.",,85,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,La Vuelta

92043,Argentina,"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.",Golden Reserve,84,21,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trivento
92044,Argentina,Generic melon and peach aromas precede a slightly forced and sweet palate with melony flavors and some tail-end bitterness. The finish is creamy and shows vanilla as well as peach and toast notes. Very basic Chardonnay given the price.,,84,17,Other,Patagonia,,Chardonnay,Verum

92054,Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice.

92055,Argentina,"Dark and heavily extracted, with a big, rubbery, gaseous bouquet that foretells the rest of the wine, which is herbal and full-bodied, with baked plum and berry flavors. Finishes oaky, with drying tannins and heat.",Reserve,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Zorzal
92060,Argentina,"Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.",Reserve,83,19,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Pinot Noir,Salentein
92062,Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP.",,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodega Norton
92065,Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",Reserva,83,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Nieto Senetiner

92232,Argentina,"Spunky right off the bat, this has floral and fresh fruit aromas that fall squarely into the wild berry category. It feels lively on the palate, with spiked acidity but enough weight and depth to absorb it. This tastes like a mix of plum, blackberry and chocolate, and the finish darkens up with notes of pepper and spice. Drink now–2017.",Privada,91,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
92257,Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",,85,15,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Alpataco
92264,Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
92272,Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
92341,Argentina,"Slightly green and a touch mulchy. The palate offers a decent mix of red fruits, herbal flavors and leathery notes. Finishes salty and choppy, but overall it's not a bad wine for the price.",,83,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ambiente
92348,Argentina,"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.",Pietro Marini,83,13,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Bodega El Transito
92350,Argentina,"A touch soupy and leafy on the nose, with a green element as well. The palate feel is clacky and firm, with herbal berry and green finishing flavors. Better in terms of feel and structure than flavors and aromas; a marginal Cab from a cool year.",Grand Reserve,83,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piattelli
92354,Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous, and frankly it's just not very fresh or inviting. The mouthfeel suggests astringency, while the flavors are salty and earthy but not very fruity. Finishes with a leathery feel and tannic grab.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Hinojosa
92355,Argentina,"Heat and horseradish define the sharp, peppery bouquet. The palate is tannic and grabby, with leafy red-fruit flavors and an added dose of herbs and pepper.

Overly peppery and green throughout.",Artist's Collection,82,10,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Salvatore Principe

Very juicy but not tasting or smelling very defined.",Alta Chardonnay-Torrontes,82,10,Other,Tulum Valley,,White Blend,Callia
92462,Argentina,"This full and ripe Cabernet has berry and black cherry aromas. Tannic, narrow and tough on the tongue, it is blasting with flavors of blackberry, mint and black coffee.

92550,Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface. Decent for under $15, but an excess of oak creates a one-sided final product.",,85,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viniterra
92557,Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry.

92665,Argentina,"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice.

92847,Argentina,"The bouquet is stylish and rooty, with black-fruit and chocolate scents leading the charge. It shows good structure, meaning it's full but not too thick or jammy.

92876,Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Four Aces
92941,Argentina,"Smells like floor polish at first. Gets better with time, but still a weak wine of juicy acids, too much oak, not enough fruit and a grating finish. Does nothing to move the dial forward in terms of Argentine Chardonnay.",,80,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Budini
92942,Argentina,"Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.",Reserva,80,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fioravante

93077,Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit.

Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made.",Perdriel Single Vineyard,93,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bodega Norton
93124,Argentina,"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass.

From Gustavo Santaoalla, an Argentine musician and composer.",Don Juan Nahuel Reserva,90,41,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cielo y Tierra
93155,Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.",Patagonia,84,20,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Merlot,Verum

93172,Argentina,"Sharp, pickled and sour smelling at first, although it does improve with airing. The palate has a good feel and proper size and roundness, yet the berry flavors are ultraherbal.

93337,Argentina,"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend.

This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.",Single Vineyard Las Compuertas,90,45,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes
94304,Argentina,"This smells toasty up front, with aromas of tree bark, earth and shoe polish. It runs deep and rich on the tongue, with a syrupy feel and flavors of graham cracker, tobacco, berry pie and herb accents. The finish is good but seems a little hollow, with rooty, herbal flavors that linger.",Inspiratto from the Andes Reserve,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Matias Bertona Wines
94312,Argentina,"Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting.",Single Vineyard Gran Reserva,89,34,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Lamadrid
94321,Argentina,"Smells strange, like a bowl of Smucker's raspberry jam or applesauce. The palate is creamy and dull, with flat, jammy, candied red fruit flavors that do little to excite. Finishes with a wave of sweet marshmallow and vanilla.",Serie Terra Roble,82,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viniterra
94333,Argentina,"Salmon colored, with soapy tangerine and nectarine aromas. The palate is watery and soft, with bland citrus and berry flavors. Comes across like a wine cooler that's lost its fizz.",Rosé,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Valle Huarpe
94387,Argentina,"Steady as a rock, with smoky, charred aromas mixed with beautiful black fruit scents as well as accents of licorice and earth. For anyone enthralled with New World ripeness, this is the ticket. It's a blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it is lush, packed with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, and viscous on the finish. Complete and special at every level.",Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard,93,82,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
94558,Argentina,"Earthy and chunky from the start, this features heavy, granular aromas of blueberry and blackberry. It is huge on the palate but shows little structure or framework to support the heavy berry flavors. Thus, the wine falls flat while tasting sweet and feeling fleshy.",,86,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Siesta Wines
94616,Argentina,"Saturated and pitch black to look at, and not much different in scent. This is a fully extracted, modern Bonarda that's well made and generous. Full-bodied wine lovers should like the meaty, dark berry and cocoa flavors. Tannic but layered on the finish.",Broquel,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Trapiche
94623,Argentina,"A rough, harsh nose of mustard and burnt stems does almost nothing to draw you in, while the palate is heavy and sweet, with cloying fruit flavors and weak structure. Not up to par on the global level.",Premium,81,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Sur de los Andes
94699,Argentina,"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",Apartado,92,64,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Felipe Rutini
94838,Argentina,"Reedy and minty in smell, this has a green aroma that shares the stage with cassis and plum notes.

94900,Argentina,"This is a pushy wine with aromas of rubber, pencil eraser, leather, blueberry and oak. It has the tannic grip that creates a certain roughness, while blueberry and spice flavors have fire to them, especially on the finish..",Firmado,89,93,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
94919,Argentina,"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.",Broquel,89,15,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Trapiche
94997,Argentina,"Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from Argentina. The 2004 shows serious barrel notes framing classic aromas of aged gouda, saddle leather, mushroom and concentrated berries. The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years.",,92,75,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cheval des Andes
95495,Argentina,"This is fresh, showing plenty of pop on the fruit-filled bouquet. It feels wide and jammy, yet grabby and dry because of its firm tannins.

95514,Argentina,"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape. Flavors of plum and cassis have a strong vanilla and oak resin accent, while the finish is tannic, roasted and robust.",Broquel,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
95739,Argentina,"A touch foxy and reduced on the nose, with jumpy berry aromas, this feels edgy and shows a grating tannic bite.

96037,Argentina,"This is fresh and open on the nose, which is what you'd want from a $9 quaffer like this. It tastes good and fruity, with lychee, green apple and spice flavors working together. Vanilla and papaya notes come up on the mild finish.",,85,9,Other,Argentina,,Torrontés,San Huberto
96042,Argentina,"Grapey berry aromas come with sweet, reedy notes and a brandied cherry component. It feels condensed but lively, with a mix of sweet, almost tropical flavors that hint at pineapple, wild berry and herb.

It's toasty and spicy on the firm finish.",Obra Prima Reserva,88,21,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Cassone
96182,Argentina,"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor. Early oak-driven aromas of hard cheese and char support muscular black fruit scents, while the palate is ripe and sweet as it offers blackberry and cassis flavors. Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.",Synthesis,90,29,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
96192,Argentina,"Dark and smoky on the nose, but in a good way, with asphalt and pure blackberry aromas. The wine strikes the palate with immediate grace and power.

96201,Argentina,"Commendations go out to this never-fail, high-end blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It's arguably a touch brambly and sharp at first, but give it time and any stark, tough characteristics go straight out the window. What's left is nothing but dark-fruit primary flavors, coconut and vanilla finishing notes, and lots of length. Maybe not the best Caro of all time but still a fine wine.",Caro,90,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bodegas Caro
96335,Argentina,"Grapey and inky on the nose, this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate, with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish.

96528,Argentina,"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.",Synthesis The Blend,90,49,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finca Sophenia
96637,Argentina,"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has rubbery tannins and candied, foxy-tasting berry flavors. Nothing harsh or sour here, but it is tannic; at best, it's sweet and simple stuff.",Ique,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
96650,Argentina,"This scents of citrus peel and lime, with a plump, oily and round palate that features orange and banana flavors. A blend of 75% Chardonnay and 25% Viognier, it turns melony on the short finish.",Serie A,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Zuccardi
96805,Argentina,"With Toso's basic 2006 Malbec being named our Best Buy of the Year for 2007, we find ourselves a bit pinned in judging this higher-priced Reserve Malbec from the same year. With the microscope turned up, however, we find a well-oaked wine with pencil-shaving aromas yielding to coconut and subtle black fruit notes. The palate is dense, structured and full of cherry, cassis and clove flavors. Composed for sure, with tighter acids and tannins than the aforementioned Best Buy champ.",Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards,90,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso

96974,Argentina,"There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.",VI,87,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pulenta Estate
96980,Argentina,"Straightforward aromas of black currant and dark plum help create a rich style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a syrupy palate that's made firmer by driving tannins. It features a lot of chocolate, baked black-plum and mild herbal flavors. It's ultraconcentrated, and more driving than discerning.",Colección,87,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Perdriel
97301,Argentina,"This is extremely aromatically pungent, with notes of honeysuckle, melon and lychee blasting up from the glass.

97556,Argentina,"This has a saturated purple color, with aromas that are green, inky and grassy. Supertannic and drawing in feel, it has black fruit and chocolate flavors that come across pushy, sweet and hot. It's as bold as they come, but it lacks elegance and harmony.",,83,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca 8
97839,Argentina,"Oily and salinic in aroma, this wine smells like an oyster shell. It feels plump and soft, without much acidity.

97862,Argentina,"Not as good as in previous vintages, this has a distinct minty, shrill quality to the otherwise leathery and foresty bouquet. It feels a bit raw and high in acidity, with plum and herb flavors. Modest on the finish, this stays fairly minty and herbal while remaining fresh.",Alta Reserve Barrancas Vineyards,87,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
97868,Argentina,"At first, this smells charred and meaty, but blackberry, leather and roasted plum aromas soon sneak out. This runs big, with good acidity and manageable tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are lively and familiar.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Salvatore Principe

98146,Argentina,"This wine's finest quality is its white flower fragrance. It feels thick like fruit juice, with plodding lemon-lime, pineapple and banana flavors. Fruity but cloying on the finish.",Reserve,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
98157,Argentina,"Roasted in scent, this has black olive and crusty, herbal berry scents. It feels ultratannic and hard, with a graphite note and heat on the palate, along with extremely earthy, demanding, burnt-tasting fruit. Too much funk here.",Hermanos,81,15,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec-Tannat,Domingo Molina

98169,Argentina,"Ripe red-fruit flavors are nice and normal, while the palate feels fresh and lifted by balancing acids. Focused raspberry and plum flavors are clean and don't push the oak envelope. Overall, this is lively and fun.",,87,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
98180,Argentina,"Clean and basic up front, with peach and white flower aromas. It feels juicy, with just enough body, bearing fruit salad flavors of nutmeg-dusted white grapes, apple and peach. It turns dry and almondy on the finish.",Reserve,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Trivento
98316,Argentina,"Very purple and expressive, with charred barrel aromas that border on burnt. Fortunately, the fruit below is quite healthy, but besides oozing blueberry and blackberry it's not overly defined or regal.

98317,Argentina,"Solid, sweet-styled Cab, this starts out with dark, piercing berry and asphalt aromas, which are followed by an appealing blast of dark-fruit flavors. Turns more aggressive and rugged as it opens, but stays the course.",Famiglia Bianchi,88,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi
98432,Argentina,"Burnt and angry in smell, this has earthy red-berry aromas. It feels astringent, with jumbled, baked berry flavors that come with a weedy note. Turns to leather and baked fruit tones on the finish.",Trumpeter,81,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Rutini
98433,Argentina,"This wine isn't flawed, but it has a faded waxy banana quality. It tastes, smells and feels creamy and confected.",Reserva,80,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Ruca Malen
98438,Argentina,"This smells of generic red fruit and pasty oak, and it tastes burnt, slightly chemical and rubbery, with creamy berry fruit flavors taking over.",,80,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Tilia
98460,Argentina,"Earthy plum and berry aromas are suggestive of Bordeaux, but the brown sugar and baked fruit angle is all Mendoza. Snappy acidity helps the wine stay trim, while linear raspberry and cherry flavors are red in character. This is gripping with an acidic push to the finish.",Single Vineyard,87,29,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Franc,Lagarde
98484,Argentina,"Walnut, banana, apple and vanilla aromas are nicely presented. The palate holds its own as far as structure, while the melon, apple and honey flavors are friendly. This is a better-than-you'd-expect Chardonnay for everyday drinking.",Trumpeter,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
98594,Argentina,"This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec. If you're not expecting miracles, this thick, textured wine may just win you over.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andean Sky
98604,Argentina,"With this wine, you'll get a solid blast of oak and butter on the nose, which is backed by orange, melon and nectarine flavors. There's acidity and kick to it, but also some softer butterscotch and citrus pith notes. More than good by Argentine standards.",Broquel,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche

98784,Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Gascón,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón
98785,Argentina,"This wine seems mulchy and warm; it comes out of the bottle with attitude and some fire. As it settles, you get berry, bramble and leather, and always does it seem a little “traditional” in style rather than modern and polished up. Definitely a full-bodied, oily wine that could use more flavor and fruit.",Reserva Finca Castro Barros,86,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
98881,Argentina,"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",J. Alberto,87,40,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
98889,Argentina,"Berry and earth on the nose are welcoming aromas, and overall this juicy, simple Malbec offers clean lines, a touch of complexity and good balance. The flavors channel berry and plum, and some vanilla runs shotgun. Not overripe or off base.",,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pannotia Vineyards
98892,Argentina,"Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp.

Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
98908,Argentina,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy.

98950,Argentina,"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors.

99333,Argentina,"Little by little Trapiche is improving its Pinot Noirs, evidenced by this authentic, lightly perfumed wine. It's fresh, bearing good acidity and roasted berry and leaf flavors. It finishes with mild tomato and herb accents. This gets better with time in the glass.",Broquel,86,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Trapiche
99345,Argentina,"Dusty berry and plum aromas set the stage for a big, cheek-grabbing wine with red berry, leather and light herb flavors. Toasty and minty, this finishes with a touch of spice.

99377,Argentina,"Not nearly as intense and Cab-like as the 2003.

99379,Argentina,"Despite some warm earth and compost on the nose, this shows positives such as solid cherry, plum and blackberry flavors.

99526,Argentina,"Plenty of smoky oak on the nose, which leads to a mildly lactic influence on the palate. Other than that minor flaw, the wine settles to show resiny black fruit, firm tannins and a finish of vanilla and mocha.

99528,Argentina,"With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length.

By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pannotia Vineyards
99533,Argentina,"A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else.

Rich, stout and smooth in the mouth, with generous black cherry, baked plum, coffee and chocolate flavors and finishing notes. Pure as can be; drink now through 2012.",Coleccion NQN Patagonia Universe,92,23,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Bodega NQN
99864,Argentina,"The nose offers a fine mix of floral berry, dusty earth and classic Malbec richness, while the palate is juicy, balanced and tastes of cassis, blackberry, fresh plum, cracked pepper and baking spices. Full and long on the finish, and overall it's right where you want it to be. Drink now through 2011.",I,92,29,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pulenta Estate
99934,Argentina,"This is earthy, rubbery and big on the nose, which isn't unusual for Bonarda. The tannins clamp down on the palate, tasting roasted, with hickory and smoked meat flavors sticking out. It's dense but not very active on the finish.",Dedicación Personal,86,21,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alfredo Roca
99940,Argentina,"Dark and minty smelling, this bears hints of blackberry, perfume and violet. It feels good and not too forceful, with regular Malbec flavors of dark fruit, red plum and spice. The finish is firm and slightly medicinal.",Colección,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Gardel
99968,Argentina,"Chunky, big and forward, with some fiery horseradish and spent campfire on the nose. Blackberry, wild raspberry and leather work the demanding, starchy palate, and the finish is short and generally clean and healthy.",Reserva,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tamarí
100111,Argentina,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",Gran Reserva,91,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Septima
100124,Argentina,"Blackberry, black cherry, cola and a whole lot of attractive aromas get this dense, pure Malbec going in the right direction. Lush and delicious black fruit flavors lead the palate, which also bring cola and a dusting of pepper. Lighter on the finish than the start, with olive, vanilla and mild chocolate notes.",Gran Reserva,91,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Naiara
100129,Argentina,"Aromas of sandalwood, violets and berries give this one an elevated, magnetic nose, while the palate is lush, big and full of black fruit and masculine tannins. A dark, minerally style from high-elevation vineyards with a coating of vanilla and caramel on the long finish.",Gran,91,32,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Riglos
100150,Argentina,"Strident aromas of licorice, herbs, berries and mint make it interesting, while the palate is light and fresh, with raspberry and red currant flavors. There's not a lot of heft, extract or depth to the wine, but it's likable and unhindered by excess oak and such. Enjoyable due to its unchallenging simplicity.",Finca La Escondida Reserva,85,13,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andean
100154,Argentina,"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Organica,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
100158,Argentina,"Given the dearth of good Argentinean rosés on the market, this one from Cafayate (based on Malbec) is pretty tasty, balanced and interesting. The nose is succulent and not offputting, while the palate shows fresh red apple, cherry and length to the finish. Not complicated but racy and clean.",Rosé,85,12,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Michel Torino
100231,Argentina,"Black fruit, leather and licorice aromas are draped all over this heavyweight Cabernet Franc. It feels tannic, with aggressive flavors of bullish black fruit. This is flavorful at every point, but hard and abrasive in feel.",Single Vineyard Reserva,86,17,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Cabernet Franc,Lamadrid
100288,Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Grand Reserve,84,20,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Graffigna
100381,Argentina,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.",Henry Lagarde Single Vineyard,91,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lagarde
100440,Argentina,"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Elsa Bianchi,85,9,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Torrontés,Valentin Bianchi
100467,Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",Reserva,85,18,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
100567,Argentina,"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice.",,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
100571,Argentina,"We haven't seen much improvement in this wine since the 2003 vintage. It's still lacking forward, ripe fruit and instead shows more leather and drying, firm tannins. Shows glimpses of higher quality but can't support them.",,83,11,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Mayu
100572,Argentina,"Popcorn, green-apple and scallion aromas precede crisp, tart flavors of barely ripe peach and grapefruit. The finish is short and citrusy, boosted by choppy acids. Racy but not rich.",Saurus Extra Brut,83,10,Other,Neuquén,,Champagne Blend,Familia Schroeder
100580,Argentina,"Malbec seems like the best bet for this organic label, which has shown some shaky wines alongside this. Even this one has a mild lactic, pasty streak to the nose along with raspberry and peppery spice. Lacks the cuddle and depth of the better Argentine Malbecs.",,83,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Medanos
100587,Argentina,"Short on berries and jam and heavily oaked, thus fruit plays second fiddle to oak spice, spearmint and hard cinnamon on the nose. The palate is on the brambly side, while the finish is fairly long and a bit leathery. Has body and size but lacks the fine points.",Ikella,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
100684,Argentina,"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.",,90,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón
100706,Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.",Treinta y Dos,90,150,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
100742,Argentina,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Altosur,85,10,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
100750,Argentina,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",,85,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Santa Julia
100753,Argentina,"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Coleccion,85,12,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
100758,Argentina,"Jumbled and jumpy on the nose, which struggles to find itself. Time gives this wine a chance to strut, and while it doesn't ever find a great groove it does offer youthful plum and berry flavors followed by resiny tannins. A little too scattered and pocked to rate better.",Phebus,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fabre Montmayou
100769,Argentina,"Pleasant and fairly clean for the price, with hazelnut, honey and a dusting of talcum powder on the nose. The palate is on the thin side, and that helps the wine stay fresh and manageable. And along the way the flavors of apple, kiwi and gooseberry are relaxed and easy.",Elsa,84,9,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Chardonnay,Valentin Bianchi
100833,Argentina,"This smells roasted, leathery and earthy, with a mouthfeel that's solid if a bit scratchy. It delivers an intense wild-berry aroma and some of Cafayate's signature complex herbal character. Oaky vanilla and dill notes accent the finish.",Reserve,85,18,Other,Salta,,Barbera,Altos de San Isidro
100882,Argentina,"Sweet and reduced aromas of red licorice and prune lead to sketchy red cherry flavors and not much body. The wine is closed, hard and chewy, but with a lot of fruit-forward potency.",Organic,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,VinEcol
100884,Argentina,"Herbal aromas infiltrate the nose, and the palate features midlevel red fruit with a strong herbal edge. The finish shows saline, chocolate and pepper, and never does it rise much above struggling.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alfredo Roca
100887,Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.",Toso Brut,82,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Pascual Toso
100888,Argentina,"Big and spicy at first, and then vegetal, lesser characteristics seep in and take over. The palate has baked black fruit and a finish of bitter chocolate and pepper, but also some rooty, bark-like issues. There's no point of focus to this wine.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Alfredo Roca
100987,Argentina,"Very nice Malbec from vines with up to 80 years of age. The nose is briary, earthy and deep, with purity and power.

Delicious and ready to drink.",Old Vine,90,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Martino
101003,Argentina,"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.",Reserva,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde

101047,Argentina,"Stocked with color and earthy, oaky aromas. This is not a shy wine, which doesn't make it polished or deft. Instead, it's a beefy, extracted number with midlevel dark fruit followed by plenty of forced, chocolaty oak. Big in stature with no likelihood of improving.",Finca La Escondida Reserva,84,13,Other,San Juan,,Shiraz,Andean
101052,Argentina,"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves. Sticky, oily and as if someone hit the mute button along the way. Where's the ripe, lush quality we've come to love about Argentinean Malbec?",D.O.C Single Vineyard,84,22,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
101058,Argentina,"Both stewy and sweet on the nose. The palate is brawny and unctuous, with big berry fruit getting gobbled up by the wine's grabby, tannic structure. This is wild, rubbery, young Cab. Air it out and serve at your barbecue.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
101065,Argentina,"This mildly prickly, red-fruit dominated Malbec is perfectly drinkable. The nose is drying, while the palate shows red cherries and raspberry along with some forceful buttery oak. Reasonably long on the finish.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Conquista de Argentina
101152,Argentina,"Earthy and warm on the nose, this has compost and leafy raspberry aromas. It shows good feel and balance, with light plum, cherry and citrus-infused tea flavors. The finish is good and solid, concluding with a tobacco note.",Oak Cask,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Trapiche
101156,Argentina,"Leafy and smoky smelling, this has lean cherry and raspberry aromas in the backdrop. This is a tight and linear wine, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that pick up speed. Overall it's juicy, jumpy and legit, but nervy. This may benefit from more bottle aging. Only 512 cases were produced.",Gran XV,85,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Pulenta Estate
101284,Argentina,"Briary berry aromas have a modest but welcome rooty, medicinal accent, while the palate is aggressive, ripe and offers the right framework for sweet berry and plum flavors.

101300,Argentina,"Interesting Malbec with character and individuality. The nose is savory and smoky, with spice and floral aromas. Full and ripe in the mouth, where roasted black fruit, clove, spice and cola all make a showing. Textured and sizable late, with a coffee note to the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Malma Reserve,89,16,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Bodega NQN
101308,Argentina,"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.",Reserva,89,39,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Altocedro
101340,Argentina,"A bit heavy and sweet, with big lemon-lime aromas followed by cloying pear and mango flavors. It's more creamy and sticky than desirable, but the core flavors are admirable and you can't take issue with its purity. Would be better if it were more agile.",Organica,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Santa Julia
101343,Argentina,"A pretty good red for those on a budget. The nose falls into the generic but pleasant raspberry and cherry realm, while the feel and flavors are of mouthfilling, mostly clean red fruit. No real varietal character but a good enough red wine.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Silvertop de Argentina
101350,Argentina,"Juicy and jumpy on the nose, but not sour. The palate of this dark, almost red Malbec rosé is sweet and candied but also zesty due to pretty lively acids. It's not a stellar wine but it is full of berries and spunk.",Rosé,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Chakana
101441,Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",Reserva,85,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca El Origen
101444,Argentina,"The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice.

101445,Argentina,"Hard, minty, oaky and even a touch chemical on the nose, then tough as nails in the mouth. Tastes resiny and minty, with black fruit flavors and extreme tannic clamp. Chocolaty tasting on the finish, which retains the wine's hard personality. Tasted twice.",Premium,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alta Vista
101600,Argentina,"Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit.

Buttery notes and toffee warm the finish, which keeps its poise.",Q,89,20,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Zuccardi
101605,Argentina,"Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.",Barda,89,22,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
101609,Argentina,"Round and saturated on the nose, with a baked, syrupy set of dark-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but offers proper acidity, and thus the flavors of cola, mocha and blackberry are round but balanced. Buttery oak comes up on the finish, and overall this is a tasty but somewhat regular high-end Malbec (with 34% Tempranillo).",Zeta,89,45,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Tempranillo,Zuccardi

101658,Argentina,"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.",Año Cero,83,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Altocedro
101666,Argentina,"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.",Reserve,83,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
101667,Argentina,"Decidedly brambly, with murky aromas mixed with rhubarb and pepper. The palate has a chunky, decent feel to it, but the flavors follow the nose: they are choppy and peppery. Meets all the standards of an acceptable wine, but could be much riper and more generous given its provenance.",Finca La Linda,83,11,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
101730,Argentina,"This has apple and nectarine aromas that are a touch briny. It shows good acidity and mouthfeel, with flavors of apple, peach and even some green bean.",Broquel,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
101743,Argentina,"Black fruit aromas come with a dusty note and a hint of milk chocolate. This feels straightforward, with flavors of raspberry, mild herb and sugar beet. The finish is short and easy, with an approachable mouthfeel.",Lo Tengo,85,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton

101889,Argentina,"Praise before criticism, and we like the wine's stocky body, bright color and mouthfeel. In those categories, it's a high flier. But there's also a briny, pickled accent to the nose and accents of olive, rhubarb and herbaceousness. Interesting in that it differs greatly from Alta Vista's Temis.",Single Vineyard Serenade,88,50,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Alta Vista
101897,Argentina,"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy.

101940,Argentina,"Most of the Toso wines are screaming successes, but this Syrah is mostly an amalgamation of extract and lots of oak.

101951,Argentina,"Better at first, when it gives green aromas and a lightness of being. But the palate runs kind of heavy, and the more you taste the heavier it gets.

102544,Argentina,"Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Rosé,80,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Jean Bousquet
102545,Argentina,Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.,Reserve,80,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Caligiore

102751,Argentina,"An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.",Felino,88,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Cobos
102755,Argentina,"Different than most, with reduced, rubbery aromas that also bring graphite and olive into play. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth, with low acidity leading to chewy plum and blackberry flavors. Licorice and baked fruit notes control the finish, which is short and chunky. Ready to drink now.",Obra Prima Reserva,87,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Cassone
102771,Argentina,"A little heat early on, and also aromas of pepper, fresh fallen leaves and dry berry fruit. It's more traditional in style, meaning it isn't pitch black, sweet and thick. Instead the wine shows earthy, mature flavors of fig paste, raspberry and cough drop. More competent than flashy.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Jean Bousquet
102972,Argentina,"This smells a bit oily and like a match, with additional aromas of white fruits and corn flakes.

102985,Argentina,"Mild varnish and lacquer aromas stem from the oak influence, and there's not a lot of fruit to offset those notes.

103050,Argentina,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today. The palate is crisp and agile, with light-framed raspberry flavors. More elegant than hefty, but also a little hollow on the midpalate and finish.",,87,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carmelo Patti
103063,Argentina,"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood.

Shows a medicinal edge on the finsih, but nothing too drastic.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
103065,Argentina,"Dark and saturated to the eye, and powerful on the nose.

Well executed but highly regular for an upper-shelf Malbec.",Grande Reserve Terroir Selection,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
103075,Argentina,"Quite the woody wine, with aromas of sawmill, cracked pepper, black licorice and dark fruit.

Finishes with another wave of spicy, raw oak.",Barrancas Vineyards Reserve,87,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso

103265,Argentina,"Raspy cherry aromas precede a scratchy palate that's characterized by its high acid-to-body ratio.

103269,Argentina,"This smells rubbery and like cured meat, and it's not very fruity. It clunks across the palate with squeaky tannins, a lot of weight and foresty, herbal plum flavors.",,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Argento
103285,Argentina,"Spearmint and soft berry aromas turn toward raisin. This feels wide and flabby, with a lot of oak and resin notes in its frame. This is quite oaky, spicy and minty for Pinot Noir.",,82,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Alfredo Roca
103288,Argentina,"A green and herbal style of northern Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon, this smells like tobacco, green bean, bell pepper and oregano.

103367,Argentina,"Nice from the get-go, with lime, citrus and fresh herb aromas. The palate is round and whole, with easygoing flavors of lemon, mango, papaya and melon. Fresh and pleasant on the finish, and perfect for aperitifs.",T,87,11,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Torrontés,Bodega Goulart
103371,Argentina,"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration.

Finishes surprisingly quick.",Reserva,87,20,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Valle Perdido
103376,Argentina,"Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend. The nose is woody and the fruit seems baked, and along the route you encounter a cheesy, horsey quality. Thick on the palate, with good structure and buttery flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Doesn't bring it all together, but the parts have their virtues.",Gala 1,87,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca

103584,Argentina,"Extremely herbal and vegetal, this is also saturated and syrupy on the palate. Flavors of green bean, mushroom, tomato paste and baked berry are undeniable.

103685,Argentina,"Opens with rich, broad, semiroasted aromas of black fruit, rubber and earth. The palate is basic and mildly tannic, with black plum, baked berry and mild herbal flavors.

103697,Argentina,"Bright but spotty on the nose, with salinic red fruit aromas that are one part raspberry and one part pool water.

103703,Argentina,"Sweet aromas of berry syrup give the wine steam and weight heading into a thick, chewy palate of baked berry, candy, vanilla and buttery flavors. Syrupy and creamy, but also a bit lactic on the finish.",,86,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Mairena
103704,Argentina,"Textbook Malbec with a nice, modern package. Solid as you'd expect, with plum/berry aromas, a hint of cherry candy and then a drawn, mildly saucy palate of red fruit. Good mouthfeel, nothing abrasive, and competent on the finish.",Urban Uco,86,11,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
103707,Argentina,"Nicely put together but totally generic, as if it were sent from the central casting dept.

Full enough but not baked or heavy.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Tercos
103893,Argentina,"The lighter-style nose that focuses on red plum and cherry is a welcome change from all of the heavy Malbecs out there, but the wine doesn't follow through on the palate. It becomes astringent, with tastes of tomato, stewed berry and cranberry.",,82,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ñandú
103896,Argentina,"Grapy and jammy smelling, this feels narrow and high in acid, bearing plum and tart cherry flavors that turn more sour with time. The finish is tomatoey and abrupt.",Estate Collection,81,10,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Canoas

103956,Argentina,"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way.

Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run.",Finca La Florencia,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Cassone
103971,Argentina,"Toasty, dark aromas set up a smooth, semirich palate of creamy berry flavors mixed with spice, vanilla and pepper.

104255,Argentina,"Floral, oily aromas are offset by the scents of lychee and lime. The palate is tropical and tasty, with peach, lychee and persistent freshness. It's getting a little heavy and lazy at this point in its development, but it's an honest reflection of northern Argentinean Torrontés.",Urban Uco,86,11,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,O. Fournier
104260,Argentina,"Earthy, friendly berry aromas are good sbecause they don't overpower, and although the mouth is chunky and a little tannic and rubbery, the flavors are deep and ripe.

Shows good feel and a solid, middle-of-the-road overall character.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
104262,Argentina,"Shows peppy cherry, citrus and other short, angular aromatics, which is followed by a zesty red fruit flavor profile with a snappy mouthfeel.

104276,Argentina,"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",,86,11,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tour 52
104284,Argentina,"Argentino is a Malbec made from two vineyards: Adrianna in Tupungato and Nicasia in Vista Flores/Altamira. Aged for two years in new oak, it's a dark, vibrant masculine wine with excellent depth of flavor, seductive berry flavors, and lots of length. It hits with force but also finesse, and it shows the extracted richness that comes from small-lot open bin fermentation.",Argentino,94,120,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
104292,Argentina,"Talk about a deep, luscious wine. The bouquet emits a magnetic blend of chocolate cake, fine leather and berry marmalade, while the midsection is downright delicious but also very pure and natural despite the wine seeing 20 months of new oak. ACrux catches and holds every note, and it should age well for another 5 to 8 years.",Alfa Crux,94,45,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
104294,Argentina,"A big, floral, fruity wine with all the hallmarks of excellence. The fruit is exacting, ripe and healthy, the tannins are firm, and the acidity is just right. It avoids all pitfalls as it transitions well from nose to palate to finish. Lots of fruit to ponder, then coffee, spice and chocolate at the end.",Chacayes,93,80,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,J. & F. Lurton
104550,Argentina,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate.",Reserva,86,17,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Domaine Jean Bousquet
104561,Argentina,"Slightly minty at first, with resiny oak, berry and mild leafy aromas. Things fall into line with airing, and the palate of savory, barrel-accented berry fruit is mildly herbal but solid. A little drying and leafy but pretty good overall.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cristobal 1492
104569,Argentina,"A lot of barrel toast and butterscotch on the nose, and also baked apple and roasted nuts. Pretty good texture, balance and acidity, with flavors of pear, banana and walnut. Long and nutty finish, with warmth and a touch of vanilla.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Carlos Basso
104570,Argentina,"Roll out the barrel as far as aromas go; it's got a lot of toast and popcorn. The palate is creamy and smooth, with apple, peach and a fairly high level of sweetness. Regular on the finish, with some leftover popcorn and spiced apple.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alamos
104572,Argentina,"Sweet it is, but given the price it is good wine with mass appeal. Apple, pear and mellow citrus aromas and flavors feature zero funk or mealy character, and the finish offers a dab of butterscotch. Shows mild residual sugar but many consumers will like that.",Elsa,85,9,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Chardonnay,Valentin Bianchi

104594,Argentina,"Never in its young history has the Clos 7 blend tasted this good right away. The '06 shows excellent young aromas of charcoal, black pepper and blackberry. The palate preserves that pepper and coffee blackness as it strides across ripe, satisfying blackberry and cassis flavors. It's 45% Malbec and then smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Made by Michel Rolland and the other owners of the Clos de los Siete vineyards.",,92,18,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Red Blend,Clos de los Siete
104601,Argentina,"Adrianna sits at 5,000 feet, making it one of the highest vineyards in all of Mendoza.

104607,Argentina,"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character.

104854,Argentina,"Big but flat, with soft aromas of baked plum and fall leaves.

Drink right away for maximum freshness and character.",,85,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Casa de Campo
104863,Argentina,"In the limited but challenged world of Argentinean Viognier, this one is pretty good. It's a touch oily and pickled, but that's a varietal trait and a reflection of warm terroir more than a fault. Flavors of citrus, pineapple and mango are solid, while the orange blossom character helps give it lift.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Viognier,Mil Piedras
104867,Argentina,"A strange set of aromas makes for an unusual bouquet: violets, black cherry, flower-scented air freshener and blueberry are all part of the picture. The palate is superficial and not real deep, with candied, unconventional flavors of herbal berry and candy. Finishes jammy and off the grid.",,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Faustina
104870,Argentina,"Typical of a Patagonian red, the profile of this Merlot is fresh, racy and snappy, Red fruit and black pepper aromas get it going, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are crisp and forward. Solid but generic red wine.",,85,16,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Areo
104871,Argentina,"Light and slightly soapy smelling, with lychee notes. The palate is full and round, with warm flavors of tangerine and lychee.

104877,Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors.

104928,Argentina,"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak.

Not a lot of fruit or verve, but round and friendly. Drink right away or wait for the '09.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Fantelli
105507,Argentina,"Young and foxy Malbec with red fruit aromas and a little bit of wet dog. There's no shortage of freshness and pop on the palate, and the cherry and raspberry flavors are nothing if not racy. Shows a tasty, sweet side but also rudimentary raw materials.",,84,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca La Niña
105508,Argentina,"Pretty good blackberry aromas with an earthy, mulchy edge. Racy and typically rubbery in the mouth, with a muscular structure and herbal red fruit flavors. Very tight and like elastic on the finish. Has its good points with limits.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Durigutti
105518,Argentina,"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.",Reserve,91,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Chakana
105527,Argentina,"This dark, meaty Malbec has some Agrelo fruit in it but it's mostly from La Consulta and Vista Flores in the Uco Valley. Aged in new oak for 18 months, it smells rich, smooth and inviting, with asphalt, mineral, violet and coffee aromas. The palate has bold acidity and healthy flavors that settle on blackberry and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2011.",Piedra Negra,91,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,J. & F. Lurton
105535,Argentina,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.",La Madras Vineyard,91,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ricardo Santos
105802,Argentina,"Standard fare, with baked, rubbery aromas and a tarry undercurrent. The palate is dense and packed, with sweet, medicinal flavors of brandied cherries and cassis. Rubbery and leathery in terms of mouthfeel, with a roasted, reduced quality to the finish.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alberti 154
105803,Argentina,"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.",Reserva,84,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Argento
105806,Argentina,"A little dusty and also sort of briney on the nose, with citric acidity pushing orange, apple and pear flavors. A textbook sweet, simple South American Chardonnay with a tropical leaning and finishing flavors of pineapple.",Estate Bottled,84,10,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Chardonnay,Finca El Portillo
105807,Argentina,"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel.

Decent but shows all the signs of the large-production, commercial wine that it is.",Estate Bottled,84,10,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo
106085,Argentina,"Floral blueberry aromas are candied, artificial smelling and sweet, and the palate is supremely rich, sweet, candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec, but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.",Urban Uco,84,11,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
106091,Argentina,"Sweet apple aromas are probably the most defined thing coming off the innocuous nose, while the palate is forceful and citrusy, with jangly pineapple, peach and lemon flavors. Amplified white wine with a vague Viognier identity.",Altas Cumbres,84,10,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Viognier,Lagarde
106096,Argentina,"Smells sweet and gummy, like a plum-flavored sucking candy or a piece of grape bubblegum. The palate is a bit punishing and hard, while wild blackberry, acidity and finishing oak make up the flavors. Lively but untamed.",Reserve,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Caligiore
106099,Argentina,"Not as clean and fresh on the nose as it could be; instead pickle and barnyard notes enter the picture. It's better on the palate, which is sweet and sticky as it delivers chunky berry fruit flavors. Sort of cloying on the finish.",Premium,84,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alta Vista
106100,Argentina,"Dusty and mild on the nose, with melony, sweet, tropical flavors. Easygoing on the palate, with decent verve and a fresh, simple, apple-based finish. Bright but basic Chardonnay from Argentina.",,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Argento
106101,Argentina,"Fairly jumpy and foxy on the nose, but underneath you'll find zippy red fruit and gumball sweetness. The palate has a syrupy feel with decent tannins and a pedestrian structure. Tastes sweet, ripe and candied, with mild raisin on the finish.",Reserva,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bautista Simona
106109,Argentina,"Generic, solid aromas of medicinal raspberry and cherry lead to a gum-burning, tannic palate of rooty cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with verve but also stand-out acidity and grab. Regular in every way.",,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
106387,Argentina,"Opens with earthy muscle but the nose soon loses focus and freshness as it transitions to rubber and paste along with berry fruit. Hard tannins work the driving palate, while the flavors are of black plum, grape jelly and herbs. Decent but doesn't inspire.",Altosur,84,11,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
106388,Argentina,"Sulfuric and gassy to start with, then tropical fruit and dusty aromas rise up. Like many varietal Torrontés, this has an oily feel and flavors of white peach, banana and nutmeg. Finishes somewhat flat and dilute, with mild bitterness.",Altosur,84,11,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Torrontés,Finca Sophenia
106391,Argentina,"Oily matchstick aromas run counter to the wine's innocuous color. The palate is light in weight but heavy in blossomy flavors of orange, lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits.

106406,Argentina,"Roasted berry and plum aromas go counter to the wine's tough, tannic, semisour feel and flavor profile. Lean, a little choppy and tight in the mouth, with herbal cherry notes on the finish. Generic except for its hardness.",,83,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sottano
106409,Argentina,"Wayward and slightly weedy on the nose, with candied fruit notes that help it along. The palate is more acidic and rhubarby than ideal, although the tartness is offset by a creamy flavor of carob bean. Short and hot on the finish; acceptable but not well executed.",Los Cardos,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Doña Paula
106419,Argentina,"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural “redness” than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish.",Kinien,90,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ruca Malen
106424,Argentina,"If an intense style of Malbec is not your thing, then keep searching because this is intense in every way. The bouquet is dark and sun-drenched, with berry jam, leather and bacon aromas. The mouth shows huge blackberry, blueberry and black olive tastes, and the finish is warm and earthy, with espresso blackness. Shows every bit of its 14.9% alcohol but can handle it.",Estate,90,25,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Colomé
106517,Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want.

106689,Argentina,"Baked, saucy and mildly burnt smelling, with a sweet, faux-chocolate edge to balance things out. The palate is bland and creamy, with milk chocolate, baked fruit and pepper flavors. Has thickness but is challenged in terms of taste and aromas.",Classic,83,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alta Vista
106697,Argentina,"Firm raspberry and cherry aromas, but nothing more, and then a tight, tough palate with syrupy, baked berry flavors and molasses. Turns mildly buttery on the finish, and always does it seem on the sweet and sticky side.",,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Las Perdices
106699,Argentina,"Overdone aromas of candle wax, incense and air freshener show the musky side of the grape, while the palate is heavy with nectarine and citrus flavors.

106818,Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Catena Alta,93,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
106849,Argentina,"Very impressive for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot.

106850,Argentina,"Excellent value in top-flight Malbec. In the four years that we've rated this wine, it hasn't dropped below 90 points.

106983,Argentina,"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney.

107028,Argentina,"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations.

107312,Argentina,"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish.

Drink now through 2012.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,123,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
108163,Argentina,"With its earthy fruit and wet clay aromas, this wine shows that Argentine Cabernet is capable of aging well. Across the palate you'll find ripe, vital tannins pushing cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a touch of brown sugar on the finish. Imported by Vinecrest Co.",Private Reserve,88,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Don Gonzalo
108273,Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity. Finishes big, syrupy and sweet, with a spot of raisin. Really good for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Apartado,91,70,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Felipe Rutini
108278,Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding.

108344,Argentina,"Consistently a very good Cabernet, with big, broad roasted aromas backing solid black fruit. The palate is rich, rugged and powerful, with mildly baked plum and blackberry flavors. Oak and vanilla show up on the finish, which is round and the slightest bit herbal. Drink now through 2012.",,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,BenMarco
108357,Argentina,"Warm dark fruit aromas of blueberry are accented by rubber and earth. The palate is deep and racy, with no dead weight and good flavors of berry, cassis, spice and chocolate. Bright in feel, focused and just oaky and dry enough to not be jammy and soft. 35,000 cases made.",Reserve,89,20,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
108390,Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend.

Good now through 2013.",Reserva,93,90,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Red Blend,Colomé
108392,Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",Catena Alta,93,57,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
108397,Argentina,"The nose is dusty and inviting, with notes of spiced berries, molasses, sandalwood and artisan soap. Very saturated but well balanced, with a creamy, oily mouthfeel and sweet, generous flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate. Mellow and delicious from start to finish, and a winner even at this high price.",Icono,93,150,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
108408,Argentina,"Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complex",Unus,92,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mendel
108475,Argentina,"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas.

Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.",Select,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
108476,Argentina,"Ruca Malen's wines never taste manipulated or tweaked. This Malbec-Cabernet blend has a robust, meaty nose with licorice in the rear.

108495,Argentina,"Electric purple in color, with a concentrated, deep nose of mineral, black plum and toast. The palate is lush and giant, but balanced perfectly by natural acidity and fine tannins.

108512,Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so. If chocolate, richness and heft are your thing, this is a winner; purists, however, may wish for more tannin, structure and nuance.",,89,45,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Antucura
108515,Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity. And what that all means is that fruit pierces the fairly heavy oak on this wine, leaving you with a lot of the positives of New World Chardonnay. Nice in this price range.",Saurus Patagonia Select,89,14,Other,Neuquén,,Chardonnay,Familia Schroeder
108526,Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate. A rich, almost medicinal wine, the type that can often cost $50. And here it's $9. Weighs in at 14.6%, so it should have its fans.",,89,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Terra Buena
108531,Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla.

108536,Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket. The flavors run closer to raspberry and strawberry than many big Malbecs, and the texture and balance are just right. This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",Oak Cask,89,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
108586,Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
108597,Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort.

108643,Argentina,"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas.

Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.",Paso de Piedra,89,19,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
108646,Argentina,"Another fine wine from this unheralded producer. Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot weave a nice picture based on sweet raisin, coconut and chocolate aromas. The palate is tannic but generous, with flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and tobacco. Chubby, rich and ripe, with intensity and darkness throughout.",Grand Reserve Trinità,89,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Piattelli
108648,Argentina,"Rubbery raspberry and cassis aromas give it a red fruited nose, while the palate is driving, fresh and full of raspberry, plum and sweet spice.

108649,Argentina,"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density. The palate has bounce and life to spare, while the flavors are bright, fruity and full. A serious Malbec with a bit of hit and scratch to the finish. Drink now into 2012.",Reserve,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andeluna
108654,Argentina,"Floral and fruity on the nose, with a strong bouquet of cassis, blackberry and ink.

Toasty, dark and long on the finish.",Serie A,89,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Zuccardi
108752,Argentina,"Fruity and forward, but airing allows restraint and character to emerge. Still, this is a red-blooded red wine with racy fruit, plenty of freshening acids, pepper and bitter chocolate at the end. Best in late 2008 into 2009.",IQUE,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
108816,Argentina,"Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract.

Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Golden Reserve,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
108834,Argentina,"At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",Reserve,88,23,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Andeluna
108836,Argentina,"Finca Las Moras is getting fancy with this proprietary blend of Malbec and Bonarda, and with good results.

108889,Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins.

The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Limited Edition Reserva,90,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Nieto Senetiner
108893,Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Carrascal,90,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
108966,Argentina,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now.

108977,Argentina,"Nice black cherry, cassis and earthy rubber aromas form a familiar, friendly type of Malbec nose, while the palate is juicy and lifted by acidity.

108980,Argentina,"Clean, light, tropical aromas draw you in, and there's also some tangerine and melon on the nose. The palate is fresh and pure, with honeydew, kiwi and lychee flavors. There's no excess here, and thus the dry, melony finish is just right. A correct and appealing Torrontés.",Reserve,88,15,Other,La Rioja,,Torrontés,Tamarí
109001,Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be.

Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.",Henry Gran Guarda,91,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Lagarde
109054,Argentina,"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Pinot Noir,Luigi Bosca
109061,Argentina,"The ultimate patio/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.",Urban,87,8,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,O. Fournier
109062,Argentina,"Bold blackberry and cola aromas work the nose on this bold, muscular Malbec-Syrah blend. But just when your expectations are at their highest, the palate doesn't quite meet expectations with its angular acidity and sharp-edged feel. The fruit is here, and with it the aromas and flavors. But moutfeel and balance are thin and piercing.",D'Autor,87,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Santa Faustina
109064,Argentina,"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.",Reserve,87,20,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Salentein
109073,Argentina,"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.",Urban Uco Blend,87,8,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec-Tempranillo,O. Fournier
109078,Argentina,"By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents.

Drink as soon as possible.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,El Fogón
109111,Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Don David Reserve,88,15,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
109113,Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Selección de Bodega Single Vineyard,88,35,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
109115,Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors.

109172,Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry.

109448,Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth.

109763,Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Reservado,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Amalia
109775,Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Atemporal,89,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alta Vista
109785,Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Serie A,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
109790,Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",,89,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Siesta
109866,Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.",,90,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Clos de los Siete
109869,Argentina,"Basso's premium blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah and Merlot is an example of good fruit meeting good winemaking. With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice. A breakout wine for this winery.",,90,29,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Red Blend,Carlos Basso
109871,Argentina,"Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose. The palate is flush and mouthfilling, with proper tannic bite, fine acidity and stylish flavors of blackberry and raspberry.",Reserva,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lagarde
109884,Argentina,"One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Carrascal,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
109907,Argentina,"Floral fruit aromas are neither heavy nor concentrated, but they are a touch medicinal and chocolaty. Flavors of clove, cherry, plum and oak are racy, while the finish is a bit resiny and weighted down by vanilla. Good wine for the price.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
109914,Argentina,"A major-league oakster, with oily popcorn and baked apple aromas. The oak and vanilla are lead players on the palate as well, but along the way there's balancing acidity, length and good flavors of spiced apple, lemon curd and cinnamon. Woody and plump on the finish.",,87,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Pascual Toso
109956,Argentina,"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.",Reserva,86,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dolce Stefania
109974,Argentina,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",Trumpeter,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Rutini
110011,Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors. The body, feel and finish seem right, so for the money it's a blue chip special.",,87,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Funky Llama
110030,Argentina,"This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
110091,Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.",,89,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Alma Negra
110092,Argentina,"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Gran Misterio,89,80,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra
110143,Argentina,"Broad and bullish is this blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is rich and granular, with hints of plum, raisin and iodine. It airs out nicely, exposing boysenberry and cassis flavors. And it finishes rock solid, with depth. It's all here; excellent wine from a mediocre vintage.",Synthesis The Blend,91,37,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finca Sophenia
110146,Argentina,"Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.",Estate Selection,91,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Red Blend,Chakana
110153,Argentina,"A year or two ago when Paul Hobbs began consulting for Toso things changed for the better. This is the rare Best Buy that can swim with the big fish and give them a run for the money. Pop the cork and enjoy lusty dark aromas of Turkish tobacco and berry compote. In the mouth, there's a riot of fruit flavors to ponder followed by a smooth, lusty finish.",Maipu Vineyards,91,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
110203,Argentina,"Sweet blackberry and black cherry aromas are accented by mint leaf and woodspice, while the palate is slightly more narrow and snappy than you might expect, with cherry, raspberry and cough drop flavors. A little high in acidity and snap, with medicinal cherry on the finish.",Barrancas Vineyards Reserve,87,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
110213,Argentina,"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.",Reserve,87,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Cruz Alta
110264,Argentina,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",Broquel,86,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
110310,Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel. The nose deals crushed brick, leather, spice and light red fruit, while the flavors run toward red cherry and red currants. Uncomplicated; drink now. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Don Valentin Lacrado,87,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
110317,Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting. The mouth is like a black-fruit explosion: muscular berry and tannins fly all over the place, ending in a lively, almost fiery finish. A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Reserve,87,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Filus
110318,Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab.",Reserve,87,17,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,El Rosal
110333,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
110343,Argentina,"A lovely, crisp-styled Malbec (with 10% Merlot) that does the Río Negro region of Patagonia proud. A Lisa is in its inaugural vintage, and the wine boasts toast, mineral and black fruit both on the nose and in the mouth. Not exactly streamlined but tighter than most Malbecs. Drink now into 2008.",A Lisa,90,24,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
110370,Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly. Aromas of sly dried berry take over, leading to a full, flush palate of plum, raspberry and raisin. Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Corte B,89,23,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
110378,Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha. The feel is full and well balanced, while the palate has a bright and lively personality with cherry, raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Smooth, tastes good and offers plenty of value.",,89,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
110384,Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",Catena,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
110385,Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",Punto Final Reserva,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
110387,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Eolo,89,79,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Trivento
110398,Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Obra Prima Coleccion,88,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Cassone
110445,Argentina,"Amancaya, a blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, never fails to impress. This wine is rich and controlled but also alert and upright. It is juicy and succulent, with ripe blackberry and cassis at its base. Finishes tight and long, and sports a fine structure throughout.",Amancaya,90,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Caro
110496,Argentina,"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",Gran,87,32,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Riglos
110512,Argentina,"NQN's Picada 15 line is a consistent source for good value among red wines. This four-grape blend (led by Cabernet Sauvignon) has a slight aroma of burnt leaves and tire rubber, but it settles with air into a good whole. Flavors of sweet berry fruits have an herbal edge, while the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, rich and smooth. Nice wine for the price.",Picada 15,87,11,Other,Neuquén,,Red Blend,Bodega NQN
110513,Argentina,"Saturated in color almost to the point of opaque. The nose is brash, with rubbery berry, chocolate and sandalwood aromas. Intense but not overpowering, with flavors of sweet black plum, berry and black currant. Spry and lively throughout, with licorice and bitter chocolate on the finish.",,87,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Argento
110559,Argentina,"Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.",Organica,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
110562,Argentina,"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir.",Saurus Patagonia,86,9,Other,Neuquén,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder
110572,Argentina,"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.",Magdalena Toso Limited 40 Barrels,86,100,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
110579,Argentina,"Slightly tart and like rhubarb at first, but if given some time this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet sweetens and becomes more friendly. Flavors of black cherry are bright, while the finish shows oaky vanilla, mocha and espresso notes.",Aduentus Classic,85,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Antigal
110588,Argentina,"Solid, condensed and smooth on the nose, with aromas of mocha and bold berry fruit. The palate is racy and deep, with lively blackberry and cassis flavors. Made from a mix of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this is long, big and attractive, and the structure is just right. Drink over the next four years.",Estate Selection,91,35,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Red Blend,Chakana
110595,Argentina,"Achaval's Uco Valley single-vineyard Malbec is strapping and minerally, with exotic black-fruit aromas darkened up by road tar but lightened by violets. It's focused and bright, with juicy cherry and black-plum flavors. Pure and direct, with a long finish. Drink now through 2013.",Finca Altamira,91,112,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer
110648,Argentina,"Dark fruit and plenty of oak on the nose, with a creamy vanilla-based palate that's sporting plenty of new wood to match the bouquet. The barrel is front and center here, but there's also solid Cab texture and power. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Select,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
110651,Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes. It's not a big, aggressive wine but it does have tannic strength and intensity. Malbec, Merlot and Cab Sauvignon make up the blend.",Carrascal,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
110662,Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game. The palate is basically a mish-mash of berry flavors and raw tannins, but with food, preferably hamburgers or ribs, it will do the trick.",Santa Isabel,86,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
110664,Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back. It clamps with firm tannins while delivering dark plum and other black-fruit flavors. Gets better with airing and may improve in the bottle. Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",Reserva,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
110668,Argentina,"Familia Schroeder is making good, restrained wines in Neuquén. This Merlot won't rock your world but it will deliver firm, fresh raspberry flavors, food-friendly acidity and solid tannins. And it's even got some chewy sweetness.",Saurus Patagonia,86,9,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Familia Schroeder
110686,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Brote Negro,88,100,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
110692,Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Reserve,88,19,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
110724,Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency. Deep as midnight in terms of flavors, with black fruits galore setting up a richly packed, ultraripe finish. New World to the max but very tasty and rich.",Barrancas Vineyards Alta Reserve,91,36,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Pascual Toso
110738,Argentina,"Septima is owned by Codorníu of Spain, and it hit the market solidly in 2002, disappeared for a couple of years, and now is back with a great Best Buy. The 2006 Malbec is a rock star wine in sheep's clothing. Shows size and power along with pure fruit, texture and balance. Lush and fruity until the end.",,90,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Septima
110763,Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction. It tastes very good, with pure, less than bashful plum and cola flavors leading straight to a fruity, lasting finish. This may not have much sauvage, old world Syrah character; but for Argentina it's made right and registers from head to toe.",,90,14,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Syrah,Pascual Toso
110772,Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas. Despite slightly crisp acidity, the wine is lusty and giving, with juicy cherry, cassis and other bright-flavored fruit. Good length and some chocolate on the finish send it away in fine form. 550 cases made.",Gran Reserva,89,16,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Ca' de Calle
110775,Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way. But once it settles, the oak supports classy blackberry, boysenberry and peppery flavors along with a structured, dense mouthfeel.",Gran Reserva,89,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
110776,Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",Iscay,89,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot-Malbec,Trapiche
110780,Argentina,"Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.",Corte C,89,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Merlot,Vistalba
110793,Argentina,"Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now.",,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Zolo
110805,Argentina,"Starts with a nice mix of peppery, live-fruit aromatics along with earth.

Shows good character and composition.",Altas Cumbres,87,10,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
110807,Argentina,"Earthy and tight on the nose, with notes of wintergreen and fresh herbs. The palate is lean and drawing, while the flavors revolve around sweet berry fruit, earth and oak. Dry, peppery and a little bitter on the finish, but spicy and real. Nice and varietally correct for Argentinean Pinot.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jean Bousquet
110814,Argentina,"Dark berry and meaty fruit on the nose, with plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is zestier, with bright acidity tempering any weight. The finish is solid, with nothing off or outlandish to consider. A good, solid, concentrated Syrah without a whole lot of varietal character.",Don Baltazar Reserva,87,13,Other,San Juan,,Syrah,Casa Montes
110819,Argentina,"More baked, muddled and heavy than Alicia's Paso de Piedra bottling, with roasted plum/berry flavors and a heavy, forceful palate that carries some burn, heat and rubber. Big and bullish, like a proverbial toro in a china shop. A lot of oak, too.",Las Compuertas,87,27,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
110821,Argentina,"Waxy, round aromas are soft and properly indicate that this wine is already turning south. The palate lacks that certain Sauvignon Blanc edge but it does offer true flavors of melon, mango and orange. Full but fleshy.",Synthesis,85,29,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Sauvignon Blanc,Finca Sophenia
110822,Argentina,"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.",Santiago Graffigna Limited Release,85,35,Other,San Juan,,Red Blend,Graffigna
110848,Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas soon give way to bramble, while the palate gives reasonably sweet but slightly tangy raspberry flavors. Some herbal leafiness enters on the finish, but not in an overbearing way. Good in a modest, basic way.",,85,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Villa Viña
110972,Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",,86,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
110973,Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Oak Cask,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
110974,Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Enzo Bianchi,86,53,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
110979,Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Dos Fincas,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
110984,Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Reservado,86,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Amalia
110986,Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Reserva,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
110993,Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo
110997,Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Reserva,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
110998,Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together.

Expect better in 2005.",Corte B,86,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
111030,Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Catena,89,22,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
111044,Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive.

111045,Argentina,"An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas.

111110,Argentina,"Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.",,85,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,St. Lucas
111167,Argentina,"Gets going with a lot of barrel and leather, but maybe not as much fruit as one might hope for. Makes its point with a round, creamy mouthfeel that supports jammy plum and blackberry flavors. A very good Malbec that will be better once the vines age.",Malma Reserva,88,20,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Bodega NQN
111249,Argentina,"Big and bulky, with a mixed bag of aromas that includes field scents, rubber and baked fruit. The palate deals berry and plum flavors, while the finish tilts toward heavy and medicinal. Seems like this one got a bit overripe and sticky. The 2003 was better.",Reserve,85,23,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andeluna
111260,Argentina,"Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",Saurus Patagonia Select,85,14,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Familia Schroeder
111263,Argentina,"For an everyday red that won't wreck the wallet, this juicy, fresh Malbec qualifies. It offers sweet aromas of plum and berry, and the palate follows suit with blueberry and blackberry. The depth and complexity are limited but the fundamentals and enjoyment factor are measurable.",Santa Isabel,85,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
111267,Argentina,"A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",Serie Magno,84,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fantelli
111347,Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",,89,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Dante Robino
111352,Argentina,"Sweet blackberry fruit and minerally darkness give this Malbec a smooth, inviting bouquet. And in the mouth, it's just as nice: light butter, juicy raspberry and plum flavors, and then dark spice on the finish. Among the best values in Argentina.",Select,89,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
111425,Argentina,"Pungent with true Sauvignon character. Tangerine, green fruits and grapefruit share the flavor profile, and the finish is mild but clean. Zesty, straightforward and tasty if served chilled.",Estate Bottled,85,11,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Sauvignon Blanc,Finca El Portillo
111446,Argentina,"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.",Gran,85,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santos Beck
111449,Argentina,"A standard wine with ample berry and plum aromas supported by blackberry, plum and chocolate flavor. It's simple but smooth, with generic berry flavors, decent mouthfeel and length. Expect only the basics and it'll rank as good everyday wine.",,85,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zolo
111464,Argentina,"Inky black in color, with a pretty nose defined by toast, minerality, stout plum and berry fruit. Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.",Don David Reserve,88,15,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
111544,Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Reserva,84,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Luigi Bosca
111548,Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",Reserva,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
111549,Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",,84,9,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terra Buena
111552,Argentina,"This Patagonian Malbec requires patience and forgiveness. The nose is milky and green at first, but airing paroles riper, redder aromas and flavors. Ultimately there's decent berry character and plumpness but not a lot of follow through or finish.",Mística,84,22,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Estepa
111553,Argentina,"Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine. The mouthfeel, however, runs kind of hard and sheer. May get better in future vintages.",Saurus Patagonia,84,9,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
111554,Argentina,"Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.",Reserve,84,23,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Andeluna
111558,Argentina,"A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",Oak,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Telteca
111567,Argentina,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.",,84,10,Other,La Rioja,,Torrontés,La Yunta
111569,Argentina,"Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",Reserva,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Santa Julia
111605,Argentina,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",Celebración Reserve,90,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andeluna
111634,Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy.

This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",,88,25,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Carmelo Patti
111640,Argentina,"Saturated Malbec, with an opaque color and dense, sweet aromas that are slightly floral and pastry-like.

Rich and ready to drink now.",Old Vine,88,15,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Tierra Divina
111726,Argentina,"Light berry aromas and a hint of spice open up this generic but solidly made Malbec-Merlot blend. Strawberry and raspberry are the lead flavors, with pepper on the finish. Not very evolved or complex, but good enough.",Blend,84,22,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec-Merlot,Benvenuto de la Serna
111732,Argentina,"Purple, smoky and dense but beyond that it's regular. The palate is racy and medium deep, but the flavors are more superficial than interesting. Finishes quick, with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.",Reserve,84,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Caligiore
111733,Argentina,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",Estate Bottled,84,11,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca El Portillo
111738,Argentina,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.",Medalla,84,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
111739,Argentina,"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",Oak Cask,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
111740,Argentina,"Citrus blossom and pine notes are welcoming enough, but the palate is sort of sweet and gummy for Torrontes. The wine has a spritzy body but not much variety in flavor. Powdery on the finish, with sugary leftovers.",Select,84,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Trivento
111744,Argentina,"Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?",Yauquén,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Ruca Malen
111745,Argentina,"A little sharp and ringing on the nose, with pine and citrus keeping it ultra fresh. The palate is mildly aggressive and zesty, with herbal raspberry and cherry flavors. With light oak and acidity kicking all the way to the end, this shows the crisp side of Pinot Noir.",,84,10,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Pinot Noir,Alfredo Roca
111748,Argentina,"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Selección de Bodega Single Vineyard,84,35,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
111770,Argentina,"This lighter-bodied blend has a lot in common with a good Côtes-du-Rhône. It's mildly spicy but also quite fruity; the nose exudes red-berry and cinnamon aromas, while the palate is warm and just slightly oaky. A nice bistro wine.",Picada 15,87,8,Other,Neuquén,,Red Blend,Bodega NQN
111783,Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Oak,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
111790,Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",White Pearl,84,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
111791,Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Amauta,84,20,Other,Cafayate,,Red Blend,Bodegas El Porvenir De Los Andes
111793,Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Uma,84,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Telteca
111807,Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Antá Reserve,84,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
111808,Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit.

111926,Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.",Viña Adolfo Ahumada Single Vineyard Villa Bastías,90,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
111942,Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent.

111951,Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes.

112028,Argentina,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
112044,Argentina,"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins. Overall it's healthy and ready but sorely missing that one key ingredient: finesse.",,84,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tercos
112048,Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame.

112111,Argentina,"Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors.

Drink right away for best results.",,84,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Viognier,Santa Julia
112113,Argentina,"Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.",Don David Reserve,84,15,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino

112133,Argentina,"If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda. The palate pushes peach, cantaloupe and floral notes, but where's the acidity and where's the grassiness?",Carrascal,83,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Weinert
112136,Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Finca la Daniela,83,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Bodega Familia Barberis
112211,Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood.

A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Gran,90,24,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Flechas de los Andes
112216,Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes.

112229,Argentina,"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide.

Smoky and herbal on the finish.",Salix Vineyard Tannat-Malbec,90,28,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Doña Paula
112251,Argentina,"Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate.

Very nice for Argentinean Merlot.",,88,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Alamos
112256,Argentina,"This is one of the best—if not the best—yet from this producer. Alluring plum, berry and cola aromas meet every requirement of a very good Malbec, while the palate is fresh, sturdy and shows a cool mix of red fruit, chocolate and spice.

112613,Argentina,"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.",Maipu Vineyards,83,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Pascual Toso
112614,Argentina,"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",,83,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Zolo
112618,Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",Aduentus Mediterráneo,82,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Antigal
112619,Argentina,Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.,White Pearl,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
112676,Argentina,"There are fumé blancs that are oak-backed and others that aren't. This one is the former. The nose is full of toast and vanilla, while the fruit is on the ripe, weighty side, with peach, melon and lemon flavors. Fairly rich in the mouth, with whetting acidity.",Ciclos,86,27,Other,Cafayate,,Fumé Blanc,Michel Torino
112680,Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Linea Tonel,82,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Finca La Anita
112681,Argentina,"Rubbery and overly woody, and the palate really burns along with high acidity and short, staccato fruit flavors. Zesty and challenging throughout; it just doesn't push the right buttons given its reserve status and price.",Reserva,82,18,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
112688,Argentina,"This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",,82,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Tango Sur
112693,Argentina,"With little to compare it to, it's hard to evaluate the correctness of this Semillon sweetie from Argentina. Let's just say that it's a weird wine that carries a vivid yellow color and aromas and flavors of honey, corn syrup and hominy.",Famiglia Bianchi Late Harvest,82,23,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Valentin Bianchi
112701,Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are also noticeably green and medicinal, while the palate offers raspberry flavors with a giant supplement of leafy, weedy flavors.

Imported by North American Beverage Group.",,81,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Domaine Jean Bousquet

112704,Argentina,"Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.",Saurus Patagonia,81,9,Other,Neuquén,,Chardonnay,Familia Schroeder
112707,Argentina,"Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well.

A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",Gran Reserva,81,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
112724,Argentina,"Exotic and refined, with a stately bouquet of violets, mineral and cassis. Sensational quality for a wine from rugged Patagonia.

Shows off the skill of Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers.",Noemía,92,140,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
112729,Argentina,"Pure and inky. The nose offers graphite, earth and a huge amount of blackberry. The ripe palate is deep and defined, with a layer or two of complexity.

112734,Argentina,"The inaugural premium Malbec from Montes S.A.'s fledgling Argentinean venture displays round, attractive aromas of concentrated black fruit and hefty oak.

Tremendously satisfying.",Ultra,91,23,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
112735,Argentina,"Begins with smoky bacon aromas that are followed by ripe black cherry and blackberry. Very plump and earthy, with a flush mouthfeel and lively acidity.

112783,Argentina,"Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth. The palate is rich and layered, with lemony oak setting up herbal, powerful berry fruit flavors that come with hints of tea and briar. Zesty as well as rich, and well balanced. Nicely done for Salta Syrah.",Don David Reserve,89,17,Other,Cafayate,,Syrah,Michel Torino
112832,Argentina,"Licorice and prune/raisin aromas indicate slightly baked core fruit, yet the palate is clangy and ringy, with out-of-balance acids that give the wine a clumsy burn and sharpness. Along the way there are equal flavor components of cherry tomato, raspberry and red plum.",,82,7,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Trapiche
112833,Argentina,"Undefined black fruit aromas are average at best, while the cherry fruit is decent but citric. This wine shows too little to warrant much attention; it's brittle but persisent, with thin, cleansing acids throughout.",,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Lucas
112835,Argentina,"So dense up front that it hints at Port. Trouble is, there's not the stuffing or fortification of Port, so what you get is full ripeness with a soft body and hard tannic walls. Finishes heavy, with a layer of melted fudge and no balancing acidity.",White Pearl,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
112839,Argentina,"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",Cavas de Santos Gran Vino,82,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Santos Beck
112841,Argentina,"This wine has never been Trapiche's strong point. It's yellowish and heavy, with a forced buttery nose. Citrus steps up on the palate and dominates, and the finish is texturally scouring.",Oak Cask,82,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
112846,Argentina,"Hard-crusted, medicinal aromas give the llama more funk than we prefer, and the palate is generic and clampy. Shows a mild burnt flavor throughout and while it's okay, it doesn't taste a whole lot like the Shiraz we've grown accustomed to.",,82,6,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Funky Llama
112849,Argentina,"The aromas are sort of mealy and flat, and frankly the palate keeps that tune. There's pulpy white fruit and then a flat-lining finish that tastes of dried peach and melon.",,82,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Lucas

112857,Argentina,"Having tasted and approved of many Chakana wines in recent years, I find this one way off the charts in the wrong direction. It's charred beyond repair, with gigantic berry and black coffee flavors that simply aren't that appealing. And it gets tougher and more sticky with airing. Note to winemaker: Back off the extraction and wood treatment.",,81,11,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Chakana
112862,Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.",Ciclos,88,26,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec-Merlot,Michel Torino
112870,Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha. Ripe and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but that said, it teeters on the verge of being syrupy. Best if you like creamy New World reds.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
112886,Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Gala 1,87,40,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
112889,Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Sur de los Andes
112966,Argentina,"Shows some young-vine raciness but also the sappy red cherry that is Rio Negro Malbec. Balanced and nicely oaked, with a comfortable finish that carries both chocolate and vanilla. From the maker of Fabre Montmayou.",,86,13,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Infinitus
112967,Argentina,"Smells a little hot and peppery, but the palate is big and expansive, with generous flavors of blackberry and vanilla.

112981,Argentina,"This is a stylish throwback, like the new Knicks putting on vintage Frazier jerseys. The nose is spicy and slightly herbal, with fresh basil, cinnamon and leather mixing with dried black fruits. Still vital and kicking on the palate, with juicy plum, blueberry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Toasty and spicy on the finish; drink or continue to hold.",Finca Los Nobles Malbec Verdot,91,58,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
112994,Argentina,"A big, ripe, saturated offering, the type of wine most red-wine enthusiasts want, and also the type of wine that has earned Argentina its reputation for making serious Malbec. The color is purple, the bouquet rubbery and smoky. The palate is dynamite; the black-fruit flavors are superb and the coffee and dark chocolate nuances just right. A stud of a wine that could use about a year in bottle to reach its peak.",Particular,91,30,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
113000,Argentina,"Sharp, spiky and raw to start, with sassy fruit and aromas of smoked meat and polished leather. In the mouth, more identifiable flavors of plum, raspberry and beet take over, and time allows for it to unfold. Finishes sturdy, with perfect tannins and perky acids. Match this with grilled beef and you're on your way. Sophisticated yet antique. How nice to see an individual wine like this.",Gran Vino,90,26,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bodega Y Cavas De Weinert
113008,Argentina,"This you just have to love, especially for the price. Starts with graham cracker, kirsch and black cherry aromas before transitioning to chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Shows subtle touches but a lot of Argentinean power and pizzazz. Restrained but ripe; robust yet suave.",Gran Reserva,90,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fabre Montmayou
113010,Argentina,"The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",Reserva,81,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Tittarelli
113013,Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish. It's not a foul or dirty wine; but it isn't what we've come to expect from SB.",Saurus Patagonia Select,81,14,Other,Neuquén,,Sauvignon Blanc,Familia Schroeder
113014,Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Finca la Daniela,81,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
113015,Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Valle Huarpe,81,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Bodega José Quattrocchi
113018,Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Gran Reserva,81,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Telteca

113020,Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",San Carlos,80,13,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
113021,Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",,80,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Santa Julia
113024,Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Tunuyan,80,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Carlos Basso
113025,Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent.

113095,Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",Estate,89,25,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Malbec,Colomé
113096,Argentina,"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid.

Hold until at least 2011.",Viña Fausto Orellana de Escobar Single Vineyard,89,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
113141,Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Flaca,87,16,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Xavier Flouret
113153,Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character.

113155,Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Catena Alta,87,35,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
113162,Argentina,"Nothing about the El Fogón wines has been impressive.

It has no body and a disjointed, buttery finish.",,81,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,El Fogón
113168,Argentina,"Pepper, green notes and burnt caramel do not create much of a bouquet, and the flavors don't go far beyond peppery fruit and green-accented raspberry and plum. An unfamiliar and afflicted rendition of Syrah.",White Pearl,81,12,Other,San Juan,,Shiraz,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
113169,Argentina,Aromas of beets and dry spice drive the harsh nose. The palate is hard and defined by bitter pepper and cherry flavors. Too much harshness and not nearly enough core fruit or cushion.,Staccato,81,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Caligiore
113172,Argentina,"Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line.

It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.",Trumpeter,81,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Rutini
113173,Argentina,"Beware of funky labeled Malbecs because many don't have much to offer. Case in point, this candied, scratchy wine with wild, rampant fruit and not much else. Tastes like a jug wine.",,80,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ku Dé Ta

113180,Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine.

113273,Argentina,"Clumsy at first, but admittedly tasted a month prior to release. Time frees up deep, sturdy fruit overlayed with a sheet of creamy oak that yields vanilla, resin and subtle spice flavors. Chunky and ripe; the berry fruit is 100% mature.

113350,Argentina,"Deep purple in hue, with saturated dark-fruit aromas along with pinches of cola and creamy oak.

The mouthfeel is plump, and there's a toasted coconut flavor on the finish.",,87,8,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tapiz
113351,Argentina,"Aromatic, with blueberry and dried jerky scents. Good fruit with earthy, chocolaty nuances creates a pretty palate that follows the nose nicely.

A solid, approachable wine that should bring a smile to the face of any Malbec lover.",,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zonda
113402,Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",D.O.C.

113408,Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tilia
113409,Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry.

113579,Argentina,"A huge amount of smoke, rubber, herbs and black fruit pour out of the nose, and that same intensity is carried onto the palate, where bright, juicy, spicy fruit is raring and ready to go.

Correct and snappy; the formula for good-drinking Malbec.",Reserva,89,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Nieto Senetiner
113646,Argentina,"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha.

113802,Argentina,"There's plenty of life in this eight-year-old blend, and the nose is like a brew of game, herbs, heirloom tomato and savory spices. The palate is plenty deep, with cherry, blackberry, cumin, oregano and raisin flavors, while the finish is forward and lively. Put it this way: this is a unique look at Argentinean winemaking circa the 1990s.",Finca Los Nobles Cabernet Bouchet,89,70,Other,Argentina,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
113810,Argentina,"The big brother and precursor to B Crux, this wine has 70% Tempranillo, 20% Malbec and 10% Merlot. It's a big, chewy sweet wine with a lot of character as well as some heavy oak and heat toward the end. Since it's the very first wine from O. Fournier, and because 2001 was an average year, expect even better offerings in 2002 and '03.",A Crux,89,42,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,O. Fournier
113818,Argentina,"Cranberry and sweet beet aromas are gritty but pure, while the palate pushes high-octane black fruit along with chocolate and raisin flavors. Lively in terms of feel, with very nice acidity providing balance. Finishes long and smoky, with pop.",,88,19,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,El Niño
113945,Argentina,"Starts with rubbery, intense aromas, but with breathing it settles on earthy berry fruit and oak-driven coffee. The mouthfeel is good and shows nice lemony acids, while the flavors vascillate between tangy/floral and herbal blackberry. Sweet, concentrated and rich on the finish, with a lasting wave of mocha.",Don David Reserve,88,16,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
113960,Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, almost like a jelly doughnut at first. But with airing it turns more savory, herbal and dry. Flavors of tomato, raspberry and herbs are robust and interesting, while the finish is less so as it flattens out and seems baked. Very good but needing a bit more spunk to rate higher.",Reserva,88,21,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Syrah,Luigi Bosca
113977,Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby. Still, it's ultraripe tasting, with rich blackberry and fudge flavors. Nocturnal in style, which is perfect for the jaguar (Yaguareté).",Yaguareté Collection,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Chakana
113979,Argentina,"Dark on the nose, with baked black-fruit aromas, graham cracker and charcoal. There's creamy oak on the palate, while the cherry, plum and herb flavors are pleasant. Finishes with fresh-roasted coffee notes and a wave of leftover acidity.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Colores del Sol
113985,Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors. Maybe a touch herbal here and there, but geneally speaking this is a solid, chewy Cabernet. 10,000 cases made.",,87,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Jean Bousquet
113989,Argentina,"Despite being a bit fiery on the nose, the aromas of plum and pepper come together and set the stage for solid, well-meaning black cherry and cassis flavors. First and foremost, the wine is healthy and sturdy. Beyond that, don't expect much in the way of richness or complexity.",Saurus Patagonia Select,87,20,Other,Neuquén,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Familia Schroeder
113994,Argentina,"Crisp aromas of wet stones, lime and eau de toilette give this Torrontés the proper air. It's lean and cut in the mouth, with green apple, pear and nectarine flavors coasting on a wave of bracing acidity. Finishes clean as a whistle.",,87,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
113999,Argentina,"Rubbery and a bit herbal on the nose, with a smack of rhubarb-like sharpness offset by deeper, more common berry fruit aromas. The palate is chunky and sweet, with meaty plum and blackberry flavors that lead to coffee and mocha on the finish.",,87,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
114253,Argentina,"Until now all we've tried are Callia's basic $9 varietals. So this is a big step up in intention, price and power. The bouquet is compact and sweet, with coconut, juniper and foresty aromas. Fresh and slightly grating on the palate, with spunky raspberry and cocoa. Turns more raw and rough as it expands, but overall we like this blend of Shiraz, Tannat, Malbec and Merlot.",Grand Callia,88,43,Other,San Juan,,Red Blend,Callia
114264,Argentina,"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.",Sensual,88,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
114304,Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry. It's ripe and round, with medium tannins and then spice, licorice and black fruit on the tail. A very good wine with no skipped beats.",Reserva,87,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tamarí
114305,Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Septima
114306,Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well. The palate is fresh and not too weighty, with melon, sweet apple and honeyed flavors. A solid wine, especially for the price range and origin. Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Tilia
114309,Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities. Finishes well, and as a whole it shouldn't raise any complaints while it may please value hunters and fans of Argentina.",Reserva,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
114312,Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alamos
114371,Argentina,"This new Patagonian winery is doing better with its reds. This SB is honeyed and slightly mealy; the palate starts out soft and chunky, with apple and peach flavors that are less than zesty and slightly oxidized. Still, complexity arises as there's a lasting butterscotch taste that is not unpleasant.",Malma,84,10,Other,Neuquén,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodega NQN
114537,Argentina,"Basic but full and ripe, with black cherry and cassis aromas. The palate has some snap and clack to it, but flavors of raspberry are softened and enriched by vanilla and creamy accents. Shows more on the nose than in the mouth, but overall it is a nice wine.",Punto Final,87,12,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
114573,Argentina,"Give this young Malbec some time to settle and it rounds into form. The nose goes from funky to finished in a few minutes, while the cherry and cola flavors run with ease toward a lightly tannic finish. Straightforward and likable once it finds its legs.",,87,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
114578,Argentina,"Hailing from San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this wine—named after a shade-providing tree—is interesting and different from the masses. The nose is floral and herbal, with pencil eraser and red-fruit aromas, while the mouth is earthy and sort of Old World, with dry, lean tannins and structure.",,87,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
114583,Argentina,"Soft and composed bouquet, with fruit aromas you will recognize and nothing funky or strained. The mouth is complete and better than ordinary, with pure but simple cassis, blueberry and plum fruit. A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",Trumpeter,87,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Rutini
114591,Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",Saurus Patagonia Select,86,20,Other,Neuquén,,Pinot Noir,Familia Schroeder
114596,Argentina,"Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.",,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
114705,Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.",Noemía,93,152,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
114791,Argentina,"There's a mix of good and questionable here. The nose starts out gaseous and stinky, as if it's begging for air. Give it time and it settles on exotic, warm blueberry and floral aromas. The palate is downright syrupy and thick, with licorice, bitter chocolate and sweet berry flavors. Rich as they come but also soft and on the brink of overripe. Not a wine for the cellar.",Libertad Vineyards,87,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Benegas
114792,Argentina,"Like many Cafayate reds of stature, this opens with funky murkiness, leather, animal notes and baked characteristics. The blend is 70% Tannat with Malbec and Syrah, and overall it's full-bodied, snappy in the mouth, and good in terms of offering integrated plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Shows a lot of heat and burn on the finish, however. A wine with individuality. Drink now through 2012.",Quipu Blend,87,65,Other,Cafayate,,Red Blend,Camino del Inca
114799,Argentina,"This is probably the best of the new line of Festivo wines from Monteviejo. The nose has a clean, fresh neutrality that serves it well, while the palate is bright and offers apricot and nectarine flavors. Turns more pithy on the finish, which is why we suggest that you drink it ASAP. Questionable value at $18.",Festivo,87,18,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Rosé,Monteviejo
114841,Argentina,"Minerally peach aromas keep things lean to start, and it's somewhat narrow in outlook throughout. The palate has melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, and there's both citrusy acid and custardy richness to give modest complexity. Like a green-fruit lollipop in liquid form.",,86,13,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Maipe
114843,Argentina,"Jammy and rubbery on the nose, but undeniably bold and friendly as well. The palate is what we'd describe as “happy,” meaning it's full, not too tannic and tasty. Flavors of cassis and ripe plum offer some fatness, and the finish is easygoing. Uncomplicated and good as a value wine.",,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Notro
114844,Argentina,"Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.",,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
115055,Argentina,"Slightly oily, nutty and harsh on the initial nose, but better as it opens and airs out. The body here is good and has balance, depth and substance, and the flavors of lychee, mango and other tropical fruits ring true. Persistent on the finsh, with good structure and length.",Estate,87,16,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Doña Paula
115060,Argentina,"Concentrated, with plenty of aromatic richness and dark fruit aromas of blackberry and cassis. The palate features proper extraction and weight, with forceful, powered-up flavors of wild berry and toast. Solid on the finish, with good ending weight and legs.",,87,16,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Areo
115082,Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Black Label,86,18,Other,San Juan,,Bonarda,Las Moras
115083,Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino
115087,Argentina,"Fruity but common on the nose, and acidic and sheering on the palate. No matter how many times you slide this across the palate, it seems tangy and electric. In the midst of all that zest there's bright plum and berry flavors followed by a lively finish. Tasty and cleansing, but choppy.",Serie A,86,14,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
115094,Argentina,"Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors are almost in the bubblegum range but are more complex and true than candied. With freshness, nice tannins and decent structure, this wine is giving about all it can.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
115096,Argentina,"Smells distinctly of cherry cola with a dash of lemon peel. The palate is medium-bodied at its richest, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. As a whole it's colorful and easy to like, even if it finishes sort of thin but fresh. Good intentions; low on stuffing.",Trumpeter,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Syrah,Rutini
115104,Argentina,"If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it. It has lower acidity and therefore size and richness. For some it may be syrupy and less than exciting; others will enjoy its ripeness. Drink this year.",Barrica,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Finca El Retiro
115268,Argentina,"A bit grapey and jammy on the nose, with a slight hint of bramble and stem. It's solid in the mouth, with kick and sweet berry fruit flavors. On the finish it falls off some, leaving a mildly candied aftertaste. Not perfect but overall it's a well-made blend of 85% Malbec with Cab and Syrah filling things out.",Chairman's Blend,87,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Cruz Alta
115320,Argentina,"Jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry are just solid enough to win you over, while the flavors of red fruit and cola carry a bit of tang and acidic bite. This is a fresh, lively everyday wine with sweet, standard flavors and a basic, competent mouthfeel.",Finca La Linda,86,11,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
115328,Argentina,"Full on the nose, but there seems to be some brett resulting in aromatic hints of hard cheese and leather. There's energy on the palate, with lemony notes preceding core flavors of cola, cassis and kirsch. Ripe and sweet, but with nothing out of the ordinary. Good Cabernet for the price, but not what you'd call interesting or exciting.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tilia
115334,Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.",,86,19,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marchiori & Barraud
115335,Argentina,"Some barrel influence works its way onto the largely natural bouquet, while the flavors of peach, banana and melon surf a smooth, modestly deep palate. This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
115407,Argentina,"While all of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbecs are excellent, this is the rock star of the group. From 50-year-old vines, Coletto offers prune, fruitcake and cedary aromas in front of a jammy but structured palate. Smooth as silk with hints of Port. A lovely, lush wine that should age well through 2012.",Viña Victorio Coletto,93,50,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
115423,Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Viña Domingo F. Sarmiento Single Vineyard,86,50,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
115433,Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Reserve,86,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Finca Sophenia
115490,Argentina,"For the second straight year, Chacayes scores major points among serious Argentine wines competing for the world's attention. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is deep, dark and seductive. It's all about compact, intense fruit supported by hefty tannins. Very nice and perfectly ripe. Hold a couple of years for best results.",Chacayes,92,75,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,J. & F. Lurton
115501,Argentina,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.",Don David Reserve,86,16,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
115507,Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Broquel,86,17,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
115508,Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",Oak Cask,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
115515,Argentina,"Borderline heavy, with stewy black fruit aromas that turn savory then murky and gaseous. The palate has clacky acidity and flavors of sweet, roasted berry fruits. Lasting on the finish, with citric acidity that seems as though it was forced onto the wine. 50% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% each Syrah and Merlot.",Petite Fleur,86,30,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Monteviejo
115565,Argentina,"Charcoal and ripe berry fruit announce this as a serious, masculine Malbec. The palate answers the bell, delivering tight blackberry and cassis flavors in front of a tannic, sturdy finish. Shows great foundation and potential; best in late 2007 into 2008.",Punto Final Reserva,92,18,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
115599,Argentina,"Familiar aromas of lemon blossom and air freshener get it going, and all together it smells a lot like a bathroom cleanser. Later on it shifts to lean, lemony, citrus fruits, with lime sticking out. Good and racy in the mouth, with another squeeze of lime juice on the finish. Good for Torrontés but with limits.",Broquel,86,15,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Trapiche
115604,Argentina,"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",Reserve,86,11,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trivento
115622,Argentina,"Here's one heck of a black, saturated wine. Cola and tar aromas abound, while the palate is borderline medicinal due to its extreme ripeness. If you like a rich, sun-drenched red with heft and body, this is it. The blend is 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it hails from vines with up to 150 years of history behind them. Weighs in at a whopping 15.5%.",Reserva,92,90,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Red Blend,Colomé
